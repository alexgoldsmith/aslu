   The sign for "incompetent" is used to mean such things 
			as "inept" or "no good at."

   INCOMPETENT:
  (Version 1)

   <img border="0" height="230" src="/images/incomp13.jpg" width="231"/>
   <img border="0" height="230" src="/images/incomp14.jpg" width="231"/>

   Animation:  INCOMPETENT:
   <br/>
   <img border="0" height="230" src="/images/incompetent.gif" width="231"/>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <hr align="left" color="#000000" size="1"/>
  <p>
   <br/>
   (Version 2)  You may see differences in the handshape.  You might 
	even see some people do the sign with a forward twist of the dominant hand 
	rather than backward twist.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   INCOMPETENT:
  </p>
  <p>
   <img border="0" height="226" src="/images/incomp9.jpg" width="241"/>
   <img border="0" height="226" src="/images/incomp10.jpg" width="241"/>
   <img border="0" height="226" src="/images/incomp11.jpg" width="241"/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Note: In the sign above, think of the non-dominant hand as 
			representing your brain, and your dominant hand representing the 
			thickness of your skull.  Hmmm. Not very flattering. Best to 
			picture it with someone else's brain and skull.
   <br/>
   Hey now, cut that out.

  Notes:
  <br/>
  Cultural tip: The sign INCOMPETENT (version 1) can be done
  <b>
   <i>
    on your ear
   </i>
  </b>
  to mean “deaf.” It 
  is okay for
  <b>
   Deaf
  </b>
  people to sign “DEAF/EARS INCOMPETENT” this way, however if a 
  			Hearing person signed “EARS INCOMPETENT” it would generally be considered
  <i>
   inappropriate
  </i>
  or even a bit rude.  Sort of like they were overstepping 
  their boundaries.
  The “DEAF/EARS INCOMPETENT” sign in addition to conveying the idea of "blown 
			speakrers" (ears that don't work) it also conveys an attitude of "belonging to the Deaf 
  Community."  It's use denotes membership. Thus if that sign is used by non-members 
			(such as sign language students) or by 
  fringe members it doesn't seem appropriate.
