   The concept of "agent" has many variations and interpretations.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Let's start with the general meaning of an agent as "a
   <i>
    person
   </i>
   who 
	does something."
   <br/>
   <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
    The sign for "
    <a href="../p/person.htm">
     person
    </a>
    " is 
	sometimes initialized with the letter 
	"P" -- but in everyday signing there is generally no reason to use 
	the "P" handshapes. You can just use "flat" hands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    When you use the PERSON-[agent] sign in combination with other signs you 
	should
    <i>
     always
    </i>
    use "flat" hands (not "P"-hands).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The "PERSON-[agent]" sign in general, represents either "a person" 
	or can be added to certain verbs to indicate "a person who does" the 
	verb. 
  For example, when used with teach:  "TEACH-PERSON-[agent]" means
  "teacher."  See: TEACHER
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The PERSON-[agent] sign can also be used to mean an "individual."

      QUESTION
     </b>
     :  A student posted:
     <br/>
     Hey, I've been watching the TV show "Agent Carter" and was wondering how one 
	would go about signing "agent", as in a person working for the government. 
	How would tat work?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <b>
      ANSWER
     </b>
     :
     <br/>
     If we think of an agent as someone who is an official representative of a 
	government or agency that typically issues badges to their agents then we 
	could sign "agent" using a modified-C-[index_and_thumb] on the non-dominant 
	side of the chest. One contact (tap) if used as part of the designation 
	"AGENT-CARTER" or a tendency toward two taps if used as a separate noun as 
	in "She is an agent."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If we use the one tap method for "SHE AGENT" it tends to take on the meaning 
	of "She is someone whom has been granted a badge and is therefore 
	representative of the agency granting the badge" -- thus either way (one or 
	two contacts) the general concept comes across for "She is an agent."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sometimes the non-initialized sign for person is referred to as the "AGENT" 
	sign. It uses flat hands that move downward and has become a popular way to 
	sign "person" (since excessive initialization is something to be avoided in 
	ASL). This "agent" PERSON-[non-initialized] sign can mean "person" in 
	general or can be used as a suffix to turn certain verbs into nouns that 
	refer to a "person who does" the action represented by the verb. For example 
	RUN-PERSON = "runner." In some descriptions you might see the same concept 
	glossed as "RUN-AGENT" which is simply another way of indicating the same 
	concept. Or you may even see: "RUN-PERSON-[agent]" which I think is very 
	specific and clear as to what you are trying to describe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you mean "agent" as in insurance agent use "SELL-PERSON."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you mean “agent” as in someone who represents someone else you could sign 
	“SHOW-PERSON-[agent]” which ties into the concept of “representative” which 
	is also signed by using the “SHOW-PERSON-[agent]” sign.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you are referring to a chemical agent you could use a combination of 
	signs like SOIL-[substance], THING, “CAUSE-[catalyst]”, “HIT-[impact]”, 
	INFLUENCE/effect/advise, START/begin, SPREAD, CHANGE, etc. – according to 
	the specific chemical. If you are in a mixed language environment 
	[classroom, lab with Hearing coworkers] you should additionally spell AGENT 
	enough to establish the term so if it appears in writing (e.g. on a test or 
	in a document) the student or employee will recognize it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you are referring to a “free agent” such as an athlete who is eligible to 
	contract with any franchise you could spell F-R-E-E A-G-E-N-T and then use 
	signs such as not-YET SIGNATURE-[contract/sign-up-with/register] OFFER-to-me++[various] 
	HE/SHE CAN THINK-SELF CHOOSE-[select] TEAM HE/SHE WANT JOIN.
     <br/>
     In some advanced theological (church) discussions you might sign “agent” 
	using REPLACE/instead/substitute-PERSON-[agent]. Note: the gloss “++” 
	indicates that a sign is done repeatedly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you are using “agent” as in a “secret agent” you could sign SECRET, spell 
	A-G-E-N-T and then use the INVESTIGATE sign while using “sneaky” body 
	language.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the “agent” is someone functioning as a “go-between” you could use the 
	FACILITATE-PERSON-[agent] sign.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you are the boss and the “agent” is your assistant you could sign “MY 
	ASSISTANT.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Prior to the internet wiping out the profession of individuals who help 
	arrange travel for others we used to have “travel agents.” To indicate a 
	“travel agent” you would sign TRAVEL and spell A-G-E-N-T. If expansion is 
	necessary you would use signs like HE/SHE PLAN MY TRAVEL. 
	CHECK-[investigate]++ FLY SCHEDULE RESERVE FOR ME.
