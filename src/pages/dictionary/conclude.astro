  Bill,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sign for "conclude" is the same as "end" right? Is conclusion the 
		same? AsÂ I read things, I tend to 'interpret' them in my head. I came 
		across a reading with "conclusion" and "summarize" in the same sentence. 
		How would you correctly sign that?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No rush, just wondering.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks! Cynthia
