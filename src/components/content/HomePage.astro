            Hello ASL Heroes! I'm glad you are here! You can learn ASL! You've
            picked a great topic to be studying. Signing is a useful skill that
            can open up for you a new world of relationships and understanding.
            I've been teaching American Sign Language for over 20 years and I am
            passionate about it. I'm Deaf/hh, my wife is d/Deaf, I hold a
            doctorate in Deaf Education / Deaf Studies. My day job is being a
            full-time tenured ASL Instructor at California State University
            (Sacramento). What you are learning here is important. Knowing sign
            language will enable you to meet and interact with a whole new group
            of people. It will also allow you to communicate with your baby many
            months earlier than the typical non-signing parent! Learning to sign
            even improves your brain! (Acquiring a second language is linked to
            neurological development and helps keep your mind alert and strong
            as you age.) It is my goal to deliver a convenient, enjoyable,
            learning experience that goes beyond the basics and empowers you via
            a scientifically engineered approach and modern methodologies that
            save you time & effort while providing maximum results. I designed
            this communication-focused curriculum for my own in-person college
            ASL classes and put it online to make it easy for my students to
            access. I decided to open the material up to the world for free
            since there are many parents of Deaf children who NEED to learn how
            to sign but may live too far from a traditional classroom. Now
            people have the opportunity to study from almost anywhere via mobile
            learning, but I started this approach many years ago -- way before
            it became the new normal. You can self-study for free (or take it as
            an actual course for $483. Many college students use this site as an
            easy way to support what they are learning in their local ASL
            classes. ASL is a visual gestural language. That means it is a
            language that is expressed through the hands and face and is
            perceived through the eyes. It isn't just waving your hands in the
            air. If you furrow your eyebrows, tilt your head, glance in a
            certain direction, lean your body a certain way, puff your cheek, or
            any number of other "inflections" --you are adding or changing
            meaning in ASL. A "visual gestural" language carries just as much
            information as any spoken language.There is much more to learning
            American Sign Language than just memorizing signs. ASL has its own
            grammar, culture, history, terminology and other unique
            characteristics. It takes time and effort to become a "skilled
            signer." But you have to start somewhere if you are going to get
            anywhere--so dive in and enjoy. Cordially. - Dr. Bill
