  There are a number of appropriate ways to sign expert -- depending on context 
and your intended meaning.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The sign for "expert" is done by using an "F" handshape and moving 
			it quickly to the chin.
  <br/>
  The contact is relatively strong, and the hold is extended.  
			The mouth morpheme is part of this sign. By that I mean, as you make 
			contact with your chin you puff out your cheeks a bit.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EXPERT:

   <br/>
   If you mean expert as in highly knowledgeable consider using the 
			"double-BRAIN / genius" sign.

			consider using the TALENT sign.  See:

   If you mean expert as in someone with a lot of experience at 
			something then consider using an emphasized inflected version of the 
			sign glossed as EXPERIENCED (or "highly-EXPERIENCED").

   <br/>
   Keep in mind that:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Many people (including skilled Deaf signers) do in real life use the 
			EXPERT (F on the chin) sign synonymously with the English word 
			"expert."
   <br/>
   <br/>
   This usage may be different from the historical or previous usage of 
			the "F on the chin" sign. Language evolves.

   I doubt that anyone has been born a "medical expert."
   <br/>
   Yet a Deaf newscaster in one of the most popular Deaf newscasts in 
			the world used the sign EXPERT to mean -- "expert" as in "a medical 
			expert.

  Notes:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I think it is interesting to consider the typical synonyms, collocates 
(other signs that tend to show up with or near the sign), or even the GLOSS 
associated with the signs to get a feel for what the signs EXPERT and/or SKILL 
mean and how they are being used "today" -- (not 40 years ago).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In general I have noticed that SKILL seems to lean toward talent or ability 
while EXPERT seems to lean toward expertise or status as a pro.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SKILL / talent / good at / expert at
  <br/>
  <br/>
  EXPERT / a pro / expertise
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would put forth as an example the following collocates:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "EXPERT WITNESS"  (using the "F" on the chin version)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  "MEDICINE EXPERT" (medical expert) (using the "F" on the chin version)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That sort of usage shows up in Deaf newscasts and/or other Deaf 
Organization-related videos.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I would then ask people to consider how they would sign a sentence that involved 
both concepts (talent and expertise) and see how you would choose to sign both 
concepts when they are in the same sentence.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example, maybe come up with several sentences such as:
  <br/>
  "The professional basketball player was a pro at the game because he was very 
skilled at shooting the ball."
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I just made that sentence up (meh) but I think with some effort it would be 
possible to seriously develop a few sentences that would tease out the nuances 
of those two signs -- or even better a half dozen of the signs in this 
discussion such as double-brained, skilled, expert, specialist, ... etc. -- 
maybe even fs-PRO and CHAMP. Might need a paragraph.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I just wish people wouldn't watch an ASL purist video based on sign usage from 
"back in the good old days" and call that "true" ASL when "true" ASL is not the 
same as "historical" ASL.

  Note:
  <br/>
  "Spreadthesign" (one of the major ASL online dictionaries) uses the "F" on chin 
version of expert as its listing for the term "expert."
  <br/>
  The inclusion of the "F" on the chin version of "expert" is a serious vote for 
the fact that the usage of the "F" on the chin sign has evolved from meaning 
"innate ability" to instead at least overlapping to some extent the term 
"expert."
