    Amazon: The 
		American Sign Language (ASL) sign for "Amazon"
   </font>

 </h1>
 <p>
  In regard to Amazon as in "Amazon (dot) com), there are several signs used in 
the Deaf community.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For a long time one of the most common signs was to sign SMILE using an "A" 
handshape.
  <br/>
  Some working at Amazon condensed and quickened this sign by doing it slightly 
more to the side (of the mouth area) and doing more of a line and less of an 
arc).  Such reductions are common in how signs (or even spoken words) are 
articulated or pronounced.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another method of signing Amazon that came into use was to sign a Z-path 
movement using and "A" handshape and then doing the THROW sign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  As of the 2020's decade and beyond we will probably continue to see various ways 
to sign Amazon for quite a while.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. "A"-(smile movement)
  <br/>
  2. "A"-(Z-movement)-THROW
  <br/>
  3. "A"-THROW
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My prediction?
  <br/>
  The "A"-(Z-movement)-THROW sign will continue to spread and will compress to:
  <br/>
  "A"-THROW.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Why? Languages evolve toward simplicity of articulation.
  <br/>
  The "Z" movement takes too long.
  <br/>
  The THROW sign is one of two very common signs for "send."
  <br/>

  <br/>
  If you want to sign Amazon to refer to the Amazon river, I recommend you just 
fingerspell it.
  <br/>
  You could perhaps look up an indigenous sign for "Amazon river" online -- that 
would be great -- just remember that each time you use it with a new audience 
you will need to introduce and explain the sign.

  Notes:
  <br/>
  From time to time you may see people become adamant and make a video declaring 
that they are showing you THE right sign for a concept.
  <br/>
  For example suppose see a video of someone who used to work at Amazon many years 
ago declaring you should do the sign a certain way.
  <br/>
  Think of that as being:  You now have a "vote" from a "former" employee as 
to how to do the sign.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Such opinions are worth considering, sure, but perhaps carry slightly less 
weight than the opinion of current Deaf employees at Amazon.
