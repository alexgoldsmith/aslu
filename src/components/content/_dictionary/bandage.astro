   The sign for "bandage" will vary depending on what is 
			being bandaged.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are talking about applying a simple "Band-Aid" type bandage or 
	asking someone if they have a "Band-Aid" then use this generic "bandage" 
	sign.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   The dominant "H-hand" is used to show a bandage on the back of the 
	non-dominant
  hand.
  </p>
  <p>
   <br/>
   BANDAGE: (as in a "Band-Aid" type)

  <p>
   If you are talking about bandaging someone's head or arm then you 
			can use the dominant hand in a "B" handshape and make large wrapping 
			motions around the body part that is being bandaged.
   <br/>
   If you are taking about bandaging a leg or a foot, you can use the 
			non-dominant arm or hand as a proxy to represent the leg or foot.
