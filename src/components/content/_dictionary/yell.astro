 The sign for yell
 <font face="Arial">
  as in "scream," or "call out to."
  <br/>
  Hold a loose "C" hand, palm up, near your mouth (sort of as if you 
			were holding an apple which you were about to take a bite out of) 
			and then move your hand forward and upward as if representing a 
			"yell" coming out of your mouth. Match your facial expression to the 
			intensity of your yell.

  YELL / "call out"
