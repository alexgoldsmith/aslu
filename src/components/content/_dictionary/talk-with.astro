  The right sign for "
  <b>
   <i>
    talk-with
   </i>
  </b>
  " depends on who 
	is doing the talking and what kind of talking you are doing.
	Since Deaf people "talk with" their hands, most of the time when you want to 
	sign something like "I was
  <b>
   talking with
  </b>
  my (Deaf) friend and ..." you would use the sign 
	for "chat." As in, "MY FRIEND WE-2 CHAT..." 
	See:
  <a href="../c/chat.htm">
   CHAT
  </a>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
   <br/>
   However, "TALK-WITH" is a good sign to know because it is the basis for 
	several other signs such as "interview," "communicate," and "Total-Communication."
