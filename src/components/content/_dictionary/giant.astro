 The sign for "giant" will depend on what you are talking about.

 <p>
  <br/>
  If you mean "giant" as in a fairy tale type or giant, then you can 
			exaggerate the sign for TALL by using a bigger movement, eye-gaze, 
			and a more intense facial expression (or even the mouth movement 
			that looks like you are saying "CHA!"
  <br/>
  <font face="Arial">
   This sign is particularly good to use for describing people but not 
	good for describing buildings. This version of TALL means "
   <i>
    very
   </i>
   tall" and if you were telling a fairy tale of some kind this sign in 
			context would mean "giant."
  </font>
 </p>
 <p>
  <font face="Arial">
   You can do this sign with less facial expression and not so high up 
			and without the upward eye-gaze to mean just "tall" rather than 
			"very tall."
