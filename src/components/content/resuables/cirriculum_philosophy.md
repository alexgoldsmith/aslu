Notes:
Allow me to share a bit of perspective from an article in Perspectives in
Education and Deafness that I also include as part of Lesson 1:

There are more than 500,000 words in the English language,
but a person who masters only 250 words will recognize more than two-thirds
of all words shown in television captions -- provided the 250 words are
those that are most frequently used. Equally dramatic, a beginning reader
could be taught just 10 words: the, you, to, a, I, and, of, in, it, that --
and then recognize more than one out of every five words. Mastery of the top
79 words means being able to read half of all words captioned. (Source:
Perspectives in Education and Deafness, Volume 16, Number 1,
September/October 1997)

It is very hard for humans to resist the urge to want to
learn a list of colors, a list of food, or a list of pretty much anything --
or in other words "topic-based" lists. The problem is learning
topic-based lists actually slows down a student's journey toward being able
to hold real life conversations in the most efficient learning path
possible.

Thus, the real topics in the ASLU curriculum are:
Lesson 1: very frequently used concepts.
Lesson 2: very frequently used concepts but slightly less frequently than Lesson 1.
Lesson 3: very frequently used concepts but slightly less frequently than Lesson 2.
Lesson 4: very frequently used concepts but slightly less frequently than Lesson 3.
Lesson 5: and so forth through to lesson 60 and on into the vocabulary expansion series.

I'm not being facetious here.

The lessons are not intended to be
topic based. Some of the lessons did coalesce somewhat into what could
loosely be described as a topic (which is what I listed up above) but that
is immaterial to the curriculum teaching a series of topic lists is not
the goal since it impedes rapid acquisition of language.

For example, the sign for cousin is not introduced in Lesson 2 along
with brother and sister even though ostensibly Lesson 2 could be labeled as
the family lesson. The sign for cousin is introduced in lesson 29. Why?
The reason why is because we don't talk about cousins as much as
we discuss most of the concepts in lessons 3 through 28. If we give
cousin space in an early lesson it takes away space that could have been
invested in a more frequently used concept which would slow down the
student's ability to quickly start having meaningful conversations.

The overall concept here is that in ASL 1 students learn and master 300 of
the most frequently used signed concepts not grouped by topic -- but
rather introduced by frequency of real world usage.

In addition to those concepts students also learn fingerspelling, numbers,
some culture, some history, a lot of terminology, and a significant amount
of interconnecting information. By interconnecting information I'm
referring to how one sign relates to another sign and/or delimitations of
signs such as the fact that the sign commonly glossed as BED can not be
used to refer to the bed of a truck nor a flower bed. The students also
learn a significant amount of response vocabulary (via watching the
interactive instructional videos) introduced when my student model responds
organically to questions. The student's responses are real and reflective of
real world interaction but are typically not codified into the
curriculum. Thus we have a type of meta-information that is included
throughout the curriculum but not listed under a topic.

I could go on and on describing why frequency beats topic-based learning
but really if someone doesn't believe and get it (understand the efficacy of
it) no amount of explaining is going to satisfy the person if they want to
see a series of lists: Lesson 1: classroom signs Lesson 2: family Lesson
3: places ... yadda, yadda.
