    Double movement.  Dominant flat hand taps the ring finger of non-dominant five hand.
    <br/>
    The non-dominant hand doesn't move in this sign. Just the dominant hand.

   Dear Dr. Bill,
   <br/>
   I was wondering if you could tell me the possible definitions for a 
			sign I will describe to you?
   <br/>
   It's an "R" on the dominant hand that brushes forward off of the 
			nose.  Someone told me (I think) that in Texas that sign means 
			"freshman," but I wasn't sure. (
   <font face="Arial">
    I'm in Michigan 
			and I've never been to Texas so of course I don't know any local 
			Texas signs.)
    <br/>

   Thank you,
   <br/>

   Dear Jennifer,
   <br/>
   The version of Freshman / Freshmen to which you are referring 
			doesn't brush "forward" off the nose, it brushes sideways across the 
			nose twice. I do not like that sign being used for Freshman but 
			indeed it is a variation that shows up in Texas (and elsewhere). You 
			will also see in Texas the more widespread (nation-wide) version 
			that taps the tip of the non-dominant ringer finger twice with the 
			dominant palm.
   <br/>
   One of the reasons I don't like using the "R"-hand brushing the nose 
			is because it conflicts with an initialized version of the sign for 
			RAT and/or MOUSE which is done with the same movement using the 
			index finger. If I have to use the both "rat" and "mouse" in the 
			same sentence I will sign RAT using the index finger and MOUSE using 
			the pinkie. Many ASL teachers will encourage you away from using 
			initialized versions of signs but the fact is such signs are "out 
			there" so what I try to do is show both signs and then indicate that 
			my preferred sign is generally the non-initialized version as long 
			as the meaning is made clear via context. For what it is worth, I 
			also recall seeing the sign for FOX being used to mean "freshman." 
			(Again, I would encourage you to stick with the standard nation-wide 
			general version of "freshman" that taps the ring finger of the 
			non-dominant hand with the dominant palm).
   <br/>
   Cordially,
   <br/>
   Dr. Bill

    Dr. Bill,
    <br/>
    Is that the only meaning for that sign or a similar sign?
    <br/>
    The Deaf person signed something that looked like "RAT" then Texas.
    <br/>
    It doesn't make sense to me that he was saying "Freshman Texas!"
    <br/>
    He did this a couple of times.
    <br/>
    I use the National sign for "freshman" but when I interpret I try to 
			use the signs my clients prefer.
    <br/>
    A Deaf friend of mine from Wisconsin signed "DUCK" for freshman, 
			have you seen that version before?
    <br/>
    Thanks for your help.
    <br/>

    Jennifer,
    <br/>
    Maybe your Deaf client was trying to tell you that "In Texas 
				they use the sign 'RAT' to mean 'freshman'?"
    <br/>
    Okay, if the "R" hand moves forward from the mouth area it might 
				be an "initialized" version of the sign TRUE which would then be 
				interpreted as REAL. Or if he had his eyebrows up it might have 
				been "REALLY?"
    <br/>
    Hmmm, DUCK for "Freshman" eh? I'll have to remember that for the 
				next time I run into any Deaf "Sconnies" (Wisconsinites). I 
				personally haven't met anyone in the five states I've lived in 
				that use DUCK for Freshman, but hey the sign DUCK shows up in 
				some of the weirdest places. I once met a fellow (d/Deaf) who 
				signs "DUCK MAGAZINE" to refer to a "girly magazine" -- if you 
				get my drift. If I run into him again I'll have to ask him why 
				he signs it that way and/or where he picked that up.
