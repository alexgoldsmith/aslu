     The sign for "believe" is a combination of the signs
     <a href="/dictionary/think">
      THINK
     </a>
     +
     <a href="/dictionary/marriage">
      MARRY
     </a>
     .
     <br/>
     Memory aid:
  The thoughts that you have married are your beliefs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     BELIEVE:

     Notes:
     <br/>
     I do this sign with an index finger and then modified "C"
  handshapes.  But some (
     <i>
      many
     </i>
     ) people start the sign with their 
	dominant hand in a loose "C" or "B"-handshape.  I don't do that because I like to avoid 
	confusion with the sign for "
     <a href="/dictionary/husband">
      HUSBAND
     </a>
     ." 
	I like to clearly show the "THINK" part of the sign by starting with a 
	"1"-handshape.
