   The sign for CLASS is a well established "
   <a href="/dictionary/initialization">
    initialized
   </a>
   " 
  sign.  By
   <i>
    well established
   </i>
   I mean that even though it is 
  initialized it is widely accepted as the appropriate ASL sign for "class."  
  Check out the "
   <a href="/dictionary/family">
    FAMILY
   </a>
   " page for similar signs.

   To sign "classroom" just combine the signs "CLASS" and "
   <a href="/dictionary/room" target="_blank">
    ROOM
   </a>
   "
   <p>
    <br/>
    Animated:  CLASSROOM:
    <br/>
    <img border="0" height="209" src="/images/classroom.gif" width="205"/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: I need to fix the animation above it has two problems:
    <br/>
    1. The "room" portion of the sign doesn't need the "R" hands.  Instead 
	it can/should just use the "BOX" sign.
    <br/>
    2. The "room" portion of the sign should start with the sides and end with 
	the front/back walls.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Does that mean it is "wrong" to sign "room" with "R" hands?  Well, I 
	don't think it is "
    <i>
     wrong
    </i>
    ," but during this day and age I wouldn't 
	advise using the initialized version for an
    <i>
     ASL
    </i>
    test since many ASL 
	instructors
    <i>
     do
    </i>
    think it is wrong. You
    <i>
     will
    </i>
    see the initialized 
	("R"-handshape) version of room show up on the hands of many Deaf people out 
	in the "real" world.  That doesn't mean the
    <font face="Arial">
     "R"-handshape version is "ASL" -- it just means that many Deaf people have 
	some Signed English versions of signs mixed into their everyday language 
	use.

     The sign for "CLASS" can also be used to mean things like "category"
