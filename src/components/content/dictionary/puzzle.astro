   There is no widely recognized specific ASL sign for puzzle.
   <br/>
   There are (of course) ways to express the various concepts related 
			to the word "puzzle." See below.

    PUZZLED:

    If you mean "puzzled" as in, "She was puzzled by his behavior" -- 
			you should do the "question mark in the mind sign" which is done by 
			holding and index-finger handshape pointing up (palm side forward) 
			about 3 inches in front of your forehead and then quickly changing 
			the handshape into an "x"-handshape as you move the hand back toward 
			your forehead.

    PUZZLE (in general)
    <br/>
    It is very common just to spell "PUZZLE" but the spelling is 
			modified by using a "double Z" which is done by forming a "bent V" 
			handshape and tracing a "Z" shape in the air. (If you were to do 
			that on a dusty chalkboard or the dirty windshield of a car it would 
			create two "Z's").  This spelled version could be used to refer 
			to board puzzles or "tough to figure out situations."

    Notes:
    <font face="Arial">
     The two interlocking bent-V hands version of the sign "puzzle" is very close to a 
			couple of other signs such as 
	"physics" and a version of "problem." But those three signs are different.
