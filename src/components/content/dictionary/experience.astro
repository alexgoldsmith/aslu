     The sign for "experience" is based on the idea of 
			stroking a beard.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     The version of the sign I'm doing below shows a somewhat exaggerated movement.
  (Pulling the sign down further than normal.)  The more you exaggerate
  this sign indicates more experience.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     EXPERIENCE:

     Memory aid:  Think of an old man with a white
  beard stroking the beard as he reflects on his life
     <i>
      <b>
       experience
      </b>
     </i>
     to solve some
  sort of problem. Older people have a lot of experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Note: If you see someone do the sign "EXPERIENCE" using a criss-cross 
			pattern (down as normal and then doing a crosswise forward stroke 
			(the flat of the fingernails are dragged across the cheek toward the 
			front) it means "
     <b>
      very
     </b>
     familiar with."
