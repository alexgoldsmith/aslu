     The sign for "careless" is done by using "V" handshapes and a "careless" facial expression.
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hold the hands up in front of you, fairly high, up near your face.  
	Slap both hands inward and down twice.
     <br/>

     There is another way to do this sign.
     <br/>
     You can slap the hands inward and down once and bring them back up 
			near the starting point.

     CARELESS (incident) (a careless act)
     <br/>
     <img border="0" height="219" src="/images/carele28.gif" width="230"/>
     <img border="0" height="219" src="/images/carele29.gif" width="230"/>
     <img border="0" height="219" src="/images/carele30.gif" width="230"/>
     <br/>
     The ending position isn't quite so high up as in my graphic, but you 
			get the point.
    </p>

     This second version is used to refer to a specific incidence of 
			carelessness. A rather common usage of this sign is to refer (in 
			context) to a boy and girl who engage in unprotected sex and the 
			girl ends up pregnant.
