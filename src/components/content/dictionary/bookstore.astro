    Notes:

    <font face="Arial">
     "Bookstore" is a compound word.  It is also a compound sign.
     <br/>
     The sign "BOOK" normally uses a double movement.
     <br/>
     The sign "STORE" normally uses a double movement.
    </font>
   </p>
   <p>
    When you combine the two signs into a compound sign you drop one 
of the movements of BOOK and one of the movements of STORE.
