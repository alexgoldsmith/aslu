     The sign for "arrive" uses flat hands ("B"-hands).  
			The non-dominant hand is held out away from the body with the palm 
			angled in toward your chest and a bit upward.  The dominant 
			hand starts near your body, palm back, and moves forward until it 
			slaps into the palm of the non-dominant hand.

     Memory aid :The right hand arrives at the left hand.

     Question:  Is "ARRIVE" the same sign as "PROVE/proof/evidence?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Answer:  The two signs are somewhat similar but there are some 
			differences.  ARRIVE is angled more upright, (mostly 
			palm-back).  PROVE starts with the non-dominant hand generally 
			horizontal, and palm facing upward. Then the dominant hand smacks 
			down onto the non-dominant hand and bounces up an inch or two.  
			Visualize the non-dominant hand representing a table or similar 
			surface and the dominant hand representing a folder full of 
			documents that you throw down onto the table that prove your point.
