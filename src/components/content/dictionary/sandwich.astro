    In the sign for "sandwich" your dominant hand is flat  and represents 
	some kind of meat or "sandwich filling."  Your non-dominant hand is 
	bent at the large knuckles and the thumb is extended forward (pointing in 
	the same direction as the fingers).  The non-dominant hand represents a 
	couple of slices of bread and looks as if it is holding a sandwich.  
	Place the meat between the two slices of bread (put your dominant hand 
	between the thumb and fingers of your non-dominant hand) and bring the 
	"sandwich" up to your mouth.

    Note: Another way to do the above version is to place the meat 
			into the bread twice without bringing it up to the mouth.

   There is yet
   <i>
    another
   </i>
   way to sign "sandwich" that places both 
			flat hands together (palms touching) and aims them at the mouth.  
			It is a bit awkward but  I consider it to be a good version for 
			talking about a "hoagie" or "submarine" type sandwich.
