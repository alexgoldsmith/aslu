     The sign for "expensive" is a combination of a single movement of "MONEY" and "throw down. 
			(Think of "throwing money away.")

			throw it down as you open the hand into a loose handshape.
     <br/>

     Note: If you

      do
     </i>
     happen to feel like
     <i>
      throwing money away
     </i>
     , 
			might I recommend that you instead put your money to good use and 
			donate to Lifeprint.com? -- Just a suggestion.
