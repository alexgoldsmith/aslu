   The sign for camper uses a a loose "C" or a CLAW handshape to 
			indicate a large object on the back of a vehicle.  As with most 
			signs, this sign will occur in the context of a conversation and it 
			is likely the signer has spelled
   <a href="/dictionary/truck">
    TRUCK
   </a>
   recently and is now indicating he/she has a "camper" on the back of 
			it.
