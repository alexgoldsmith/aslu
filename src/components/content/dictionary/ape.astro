   As with many "very short" English words the concept of "ape" is 
			typically just fingerspelled.

    If you are telling a story (particularly to children) you very well 
			may choose to thump on your chest a couple of times as if you were 
			an ape.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sign for "gorilla" tends to just use the chest thumping 
			movement.
    <br/>
    If you need to distinguish between an "ape" and a "gorilla" you have 
			a couple of options:
    <br/>
    1.  Fingerspell A-P-E and sign "gorilla" by thumping your 
			chest.
    <br/>
    2.  Thump your chest a couple times with "A" hands (palm-side 
			facing toward your chest) to mean "ape."  Thump your chest a 
			couple of times with "S" hands to mean "gorilla."

    Note: On first usage, if it is important to be specific about 
			whether your are signing "ape" or "gorilla" it is a good practice to 
			"fingerspell" either concept at least once for clarification.
