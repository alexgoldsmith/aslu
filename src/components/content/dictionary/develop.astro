   The concept of develop or development holds up the non-dominant 
			flat-hand palm facing forward, fingertips pointing up.
   <br/>
   The thumb-side of the flat dominant hand is placed perpendicular on 
			the non-dominant palm.  The fingertips are aimed up and to the 
			non-dominant side as if representing an upward slope.  (Memory 
			aid: Think of a chart on the wall with a line showing a company's 
			growth (development) over a period of time.
