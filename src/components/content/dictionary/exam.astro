     The sign for "exam" as in "a test" is generally done by doing the TEST 
			sign.  See:
     <a href="/dictionary/test">
      TEST
     </a>
    </p>
    <hr align="left" color="#000000" size="1" width="50%"/>
    <p>
     If you mean "exam" as in "eye exam" then use the sign for "
     <a href="/dictionary/investigate">
      INVESTIGATE
     </a>
     "
    </p>
    <hr align="left" color="#000000" size="1" width="50%"/>
    <p>
     If you are talking about an exam as in going to the doctor for a 
			"physical exam" then you could either sign "BODY INVESTIGATE" or 
			more commonly: BODY "
     <a href="/dictionary/analyze">
      ANALYZE
     </a>
     "
    </p>

     Notes:
     <br/>
     Dear Dr. Bill,
     <br/>
     I work as an ophthalmic technician at Hollaway Eye Associates. I've 
			been learning ASL and hope to be certified one day. For work 
			purposes though, I was wondering what the sign for exam, as in an 
			eye exam, would be? I looked online for awhile buy I just wasn't 
			finding anything. I know you must be incredibly busy, definitely in 
			the fall season, but if you get the chance, any advice would help. 
			:)

     Amanda,
     <br/>
     Hello :)
     <br/>
     The best sign for "exam" when referring to an "eye exam" is the 
			"CHECK" sign repeated twice -- which can be used to mean 
			"investigate."
     <br/>
     Cordially,
     <br/>
     Dr. Bill
