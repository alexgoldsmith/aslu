   The sign for that's-life is also used for "tough luck" and tends to 
			be shown by spelling the letters TL while throwing the hand forward 
			(sort of like throwing it in the face of the person to whom you are 
			signing.) The "L" ends up with the palm at about a 45 degree angle 
			(by that I mean that the palm is facing halfway down, halfway 
			forward).
