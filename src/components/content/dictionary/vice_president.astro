      I was asked to interpret in a 
		union meeting for 2 Deaf ladies -- something that is totally out of my field as I am used to interpreting in my church. I did a 
		lot of fingerspelling, and thank the 2 Deaf ladies for returning the signs for words I didn't know, words like super-annuation 
		and trusteeship.  Is VP commonly used for vice president? Or is that more for Video-Phone? The first time I signed vice 
		president, I spelled VICE and signed president, but after that, I signed VP and they understood me.

    Hi Cydrina,
    <br/>
    <font face="Arial">
     I use the fingerspelled letters "V-P" (in the normal / neutral 
		fingerspelling area) to mean
     <b>
      video phone
     </b>
     .
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="Arial">
     <br/>
     I sign "
     <b>
      vice president
     </b>
     " by touching the index finger of the "V" hand to the side of my forehead and then 
		smoothly changing it into a "P" (still near but not touching the 
		forehead).
    </font>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <font face="Arial">
     I've seen some people sign "vice president" by touching the tip of the 
		index finger of their dominant "V" hand to their temple and then signing
     <a href="/dictionary/president">
      PRESIDENT
     </a>
     as normal.
