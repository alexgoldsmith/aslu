     ORDER or COMMAND:
    </font>
    If you are doing the sign for "order" as in "give a command" use a 
	stern facial expression.  If you are meaning "order" as in "order a 
	meal" at a restaurant, then you don't need to use a stern facial expression. 
	Also sometimes you may see the sign "order" start in the same position,
  but then both hands move to the dominant side (right side if you are 
	right-handed) slightly, then move forward
  (tracing a 7 shape.)
