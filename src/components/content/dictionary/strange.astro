     Notes:
     <br/>
     STRANGER:  The English concept of "stranger" (as in an unknown 
			person) doesn't have a directly equivalent sign in ASL.
     <br/>
     Some people sign "STRANGE +
     <a href="/dictionary/agent">
      PERSON/AGENT
     </a>
     " to mean
  			"stranger."
     <br/>
     I don't really recommend that approach, but if you do decide to use 
			the signs STRANGE and PERSON to mean to mean "someone you
  don't know" then you'll want to do a more mild facial
  expression. If you are referring to some new weirdo stalking you, then by all means, go ahead and use
  the "strange" sign and facial expression.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, I think it would be good to understand that most of the 
			time the concept of "stranger" would be conveyed through a different 
			set of signs. For example:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Example: "DAD, SOMEONE THERE DOOR, don't-KNOW WHO, NEVER SEE BEFORE.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Another way to express the concept of "stranger" (as in someone that 
			you don't know) is by signing "
     <a href="/dictionary/new">
      NEW
     </a>
     +
     <a href="/dictionary/agent">
      AGENT
     </a>
     ."
