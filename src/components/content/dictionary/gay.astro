          Hi Bill,
          <br/>
          I am a student at the University of Minnesota, currently in ASL 3. I  have the Random House Webster's ASL Dictionary, 
			but I often rely on 
			your site for current, cultural descriptions of signs. (The personal, anecdotal information is much more useful than a 
			basic dictionary.)
          <br/>
          So, I was wondering if you could add signs for gay, lesbian, etc? 
			(Or  are they already on the site somewhere and I'm just 
			missing them?) Do
			you recommend using the initialized signs on the chin or is there something more up-to-date? You could also add signs 
			for "partner" and
          <br/>
          other related signs.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Thanks for your help,

        Hi Amy,
        <br/>
        I can put those signs on my to do list.
        <br/>
        It might be a while since the "to do" list is pretty long.
        <br/>
        But at least they will be in the pipe for eventual inclusion.
        <br/>
        I just do the initialized "GAY" / "LESBIAN" signs on the chin. Or if in an unknown group I'll spell G-A-Y.  For partner I 
		do the "
        <a href="/dictionary/roommate">
         roommate
        </a>
        " sign.
        <br/>

      Hi my name is Shane a returning adult student with UWL but withdrew to possibly 
just finish at MTC in Wisconsin so I can at least maybe get a certificate as 
well as my degree. My major is in Interpersonal Communications and had a 
deaf/mute boyfriend while at UWL. I see the comments in response to doing the 
sign for "GAY" and if any help, being a gay man, i find that the chin movement 
is what is told to me all the time by gay men who are Deaf. I did the ear lobe 
and they looked at me and even chuckled. Just a thought if it would help. the 
chin is what i am instructed by gay men to use, at least here in Wisconsin gay 
community. *smile*

      My apologies for using the term Deaf/mute in the message i sent you in regards 
to the sign for "gay." I certainly am studying the language and meeting people 
locally and through websites. I was directed to this article by a Deaf man who 
was friends with my former boyfriend after he noticed the words i used in the 
message i sent to you that you posted on your site. He was not mad, but just 
shared this article.

      Maybe you could post this underneath message if you, or other people, think it 
was not proper to use term.

      p.s. do you yourself think it was not polite? With the communication still being 
limited while we dated he probably never knew i was using term. We are still 
great friends though and chat via webcam a lot to have him see my progress or 
when he uses video phone i can at same time listen to interpreter and watch him 
sign with them as i try to notice what is being used as he signs and interpreter 
talks to me.

      Dear Shane,
      <br/>
      Honest people making an honest effort rarely need to apologize -- yet they often 
do apologize as a way of making it clear that any harm inflicted was certainly
      <i>
       unintentional
      </i>
      . I know that is what you are doing now.
      <br/>
      Sure I'd be happy to post the correspondence as you request, but just so you'll 
know, there is a movement amongst some in the Deaf community to
      <i>
       reclaim
      </i>
      the word "mute" and make it our own! There are indeed many Deaf MUTE 
(capitalization for emphasis) people -- namely those Deaf who do NOT voice. 
Within our community there are those who have actively blogged about and 
promoted the concept of using the word MUTE proudly to denote being a Deaf 
person who doesn't voice.
      <br/>
      This movement is very similar to the movements that have taken place within 
other communities to reclaim their labels. Do you consider the word "gay" to be 
offensive? Or the word "queer?" Why or why not? Were those words offensive at 
one time? Offensive to whom? (Implied vs inferred?) If they are no longer 
offensive when and how did they stop being so? Isn't it logical to assume that 
other groups will also eventually wrest their labels from the larger 
(oppressive) society and dictate what those labels mean?
      <br/>

        After reading your message i thought to myself, "I hope he posts his

		people use for the word "gay" being it does vary. Seeing the title/name 
		of the organization "National Association for the Deaf" after the other 
		man directed me to article, and politely told me it was best not to use 
		the term, i thought he was speaking for everyone. Thank you for your 
		thoughts and opinion on the subject. I guess like Micah stated to me it 
		never crosses my mind when i hear various terms or words in reference to 
		my sexual orientation. Not to say that i don't see a lot of people get 
		furious when various words are used. *smile*

       Dear Shane,
       <br/>
       Culture is a moving target. Every once in a while I come across something I 
	posted online 10 years ago and I wince and think, "did I write THAT?!?" 
	People tend to think of culture as a melting pot. It isn't. It is like a
       <i>
        salad
       </i>
       , with bits and hunks of food all jumbled together. The salad 
	evolves over time, but it is always full of bits and chunks of separate food 
	types. The challenge is when an eater sits down and sticks his/her fork into 
	the salad and comes up with a bit of onion and some chicken on that fork. 
	(This is very common if you get a salad at a fast food chain, they put the 
	meat on top to make it look more impressive.) He or she may initially 
	conclude that salad is mostly about
       <i>
        chicken and onion
       </i>
       .
       <br/>
       <br/>
       It is not until a person has stuck his fork in and sampled many bites from 
	the salad bowl that the person has a true sense of what that particular 
	salad is all about. And it isn't until that person has eaten that "type" of 
	salad at a variety of restaurants in a variety of cities that he/she could 
	really be considered familiar with that salad. Even more interesting is if 
	he goes back to the same restaurant 10 years later and there is a different 
	chef preparing that "same" salad -- the salad may taste quite different.
       <br/>
      </font>
     </div>
     <div>
      <font size="2">
       When the NAD "says" this is the way it is, you should take 
	that as an indication that a very large percentage of the American Deaf 
	Community indeed felt that way about that topic
       <i>
        at the time
       </i>
       of that 
	article. THEN you start asking questions like: "How old is this article?" 
	"How 'hot' is this topic?" "Are technological or societal changes likely to 
	influence how this topic is viewed?"
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Certainly, for many years the word "mute" was
       <em>
        considered
       </em>
       "offensive" by the general Deaf community, but that was during the time when 
	"audism" (a form of racism against the Deaf) promoted the idea that being 
	able to voice was somehow better than being able to sign. Once you remove 
	"audism" where is the "offense" of being called mute? It is no more 
	offensive to be called "mute" than it is to be called "brunette," "Jew," 
	"Gay," or "Black."
       <br/>
       <br/>
       At the point when parents, administrators, educators, and Deaf adults start 
	communicating to Deaf children that being Deaf means to be part of a rich 
	and compelling heritage of language, culture, and community -- those Deaf 
	children no longer "take offense" at being called mute, but rather they see 
	it as a source of pride and identity.

       [The Mute Room]
       <br/>
       In the summer of 2006 I received an email from Marci Wilson, a wonderful 
	person and at the time interpreter coordinator for Carson City School 
	District in Nevada. She and I had discussed methods of encouraging the use 
	of sign language in the district and I had suggested the teachers create a 
	room or area that was to be a "highly visual environment" wherein the 
	participants (including the Hearing people) would communicate
       <i>
        only
       </i>
       in 
	sign language. She wrote:
       <br/>
       <font color="#330066">
        Hey, we started our "silent classroom" on Monday. 
	The kids named it "The Deaf Room". They wanted to name it "The Deaf Mute 
	Room" because they see "mute" on the remote [control device] and it means 
	"no sound". We talked about the connotations from the past, but said it was 
	their choice...new day, new way and all...but they decided "The Deaf Room" 
	would be more accepted if Deaf adults came to visit. I love it! The 
	interpreters are a little reluctant but the kids love it, too. Thanks for 
	the suggestion.

       We now have a generation of Deaf who have a totally fresh understanding of 
	the term "mute."
       <br/>
       Back in 2006 I wrote that "theoretically it would be possible for the term 
	'mute' to make an in-your-face comeback." This is no longer theory. Just as 
	there are zeitgeist websites out there devoted to "crip" humor for the 
	"severely euphemized," we are seeing and have seen semantic evolution of the 
	term "mute."
