     If you can and for my own person curiosity, how under the sun do 
			you sign "guinea pig"?? No one can tell me!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Dear Curious,
     <br/>
     Just spell "g-u-i-n-e-a" and then sign PIG.
     <br/>
     You'd do that on the first reference. Then afterward during that 
			same conversation you just sign "PIG." (Unless it were a lecture on 
			different types of pigs eh? If you need to differentiate between 
			types of pigs then you'd need to keep being specific.)
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If I had a magic wand I'd zap myself to "New Guinea" and find out 
			the sign for that country (the word "Guinea") from the local native 
			Deaf. Then I'd use
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     sign combined with our sign for pig. 
			But, lacking such a magic wand maybe there is a New Guinea website 
			showing signs from their country?  But here in the U.S. not 
			many people know or use a sign for "Guinea" (at least none of the 
			folks I've interviewed).
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Another thing to keep in mind is that much of the time when someone 
			says (in English) the phase "guinea pig" they are not talking about 
			a cute little pet. They are really talking about "testing out 
			something new on someone or something."  In that case I'd sign 
			"TEST PIG."  I were talking about the idea of someone or 
			something being used as a test or prototype.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     My suggestion for an actual dedicated sign to use (if I were talking 
			about a real "guinea pig") would be to spell it out on first usage 
			then I'd do the sign for "swollen cheeks" and then pig. (Swollen 
			cheeks would be signed with "claw" hands on each cheek.)  Then 
			for the rest of that conversation I could sign "swollen cheeks" to 
			mean "guinea pig" (without needing to add the sign PIG." Of course, 
			"no one" beyond that immediate conversation would have any clue what 
			I was talking about, but it would work well during that particular 
			conversation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Again, remember, if I were not discussing any type of pig other than 
			guinea pigs, after I indicated "guinea" the first time or two, I'd 
			just drop it and only sign "pig." The other person would still
     <i>
      understand
     </i>
     that I was talking about the cute little furry ones 
			and not the big mud covered ones.

    I am looking for the signs for Dragon, Guinea Pig, and Hamster. Any

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Thank you.

    J. Brotnov,
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sign for hamster is to sign "mouse" and then puff out your 
			cheeks and put your right and left "claw" handshapes on your cheeks 
			to show cheeks full of nuts.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The sign dragon is to place the back of the right "and" handshape up 
			against your snarled mouth. Then "shoot" the handshape forward while 
			wiggling the fingers as if to represent a dragon blowing fire.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    To sign Guinea Pig, you can combine the signs: TEST and PIG, or you 
			can sign "big cheeks" by using claw hands on your cheeks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I hope that helps. Good luck in your signing endeavors.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Dr. Bill
