    he sign for "hungry"
is made by forming your right hand into the letter "c."
    <p>
     Move your hand down the middle of your chest. You don't actually have to 
touch your body but most people do -- especially if they want to emphasize how 
hungry they are with a stronger movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sign for "hungry" is also the same 
	as the sign for
"
     <b>
      wish
     </b>
     ."  Some people start the sign for "wish" on the
upper chest  and prefer to start "hungry" from a slightly lower position.
	I don't mess around with that.  But if it helps as a memory aid, think of a "wish" coming from your heart, and hunger coming from your
belly.  But, again, it is okay to use the same sign for both concepts.

    Note that the concept of "are" as a question form is expressed in ASL via 
	raising the eyebrows and tilting the head a bit.
