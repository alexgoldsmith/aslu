    RETIRE:  is like the sign for vacation but instead of using the "five" 
handshape you would use an "R" handshape with your thumbs extended.

    The sign retire is related to the sign "vacation." To sign "vacation"
(lightly) jab your thumbs into your chest an inch or two to the side of your armpits. Think of
a farmer taking a break or a vacation and sticking his thumbs in his overall's
suspenders.  If you use a single motion it means "time off" or
"off work."  If you use a double motion it means an actual
"vacation" or "period of not working."

     A hint to remember this sign is to think of a farmer who is taking a
     <b>
      break
     </b>
     with his thumbs in his suspenders.
