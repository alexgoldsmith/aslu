    The sign for "proud or pride" uses a modified "A" hand. (The thumb is 
sticking out.) The hand doesn't have to make contact with the chest. It is 
okay to do the sign either way.

    PROUD:

    Memory aid: A way to remember this sign is to imagine a farmer looking over 
his crop with pride and running his thumb up one of his suspenders.

    Sample sentence:
    <br/>
    YOU PROUD ABOUT WHAT? (What do you take pride in?)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: You can drop the sign "ABOUT" in the above sentence = "YOU PROUD WHAT" 
which could mean, "What are you proud of?"
