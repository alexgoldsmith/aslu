    Donna,
    <br/>
    <font face="Arial">
     The sign for "accent" is done by poking your throat 
	(lightly) with your index finger.  You can poke it either once or 
	twice. (But I only poke once.)  I agree with you in that what you have 
	is more of a "lisp" than an accent, but the interpreter was right in that a 
	"common" way of referring to signing that is different from the norm is to 
	refer to it as "having an accent."
