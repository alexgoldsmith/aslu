    The sign for compliment is a modified version of the sign for SCHOOL 
			and/or CLAP.  The difference between the two signs is that the 
			sign for compliment is done a bit softer and the contact is more 
			from the finger area of the dominant hand to the palm area of the 
			non-dominant hand, (not so much palm to palm contact as in the 
			general sign for SCHOOL).
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Also the sign COMPLIMENT is sometimes held a bit more out from the 
			body -- especially if you are complimenting someone directly (done 
			slightly in the direction of the person receiving the compliment).

    Also, you could express the concept of "compliment" via other 
			methods such as informing someone that someone else had said 
			something
