   The sign for "Baltimore" uses a "B" hand (a flat hand) that slices 
			downward a couple times.

    Notes:
    <br/>
    Here is a video of Byron doing the sign "Baltimore." He is repeating 
			the sign numerous times in an effort to show you how it moves. In 
			everyday life you just need to use two downward movements. (Down, 
			up, down).

    Notes:
    <br/>
    I've seen some people do a downward slice and then move the hand a 
			bit to the side and do an other downward slice. Personally I 
			recommend you just stick with doing two quick 
			downward slice movements in the same location.
