     Hello Dr. Bill,
     <br/>
     I am a Speech Language Pathologist working in a school setting. I was 
	wondering if there was a sign for the word “Ipad”. I tried searching for it 
	but was unsuccessful.
     <br/>
     Thanks,
     <br/>

    Kathy,
    <br/>
    There is no widely accepted sign for I-pad (yet).
    <br/>
    Most people just spell it.
    <br/>
    My younger daughter, (who due to lack of joints in her fingers doesn't 
	spell) uses a sign that mimes the use of the ipad.
    <br/>
    Another approach is to use "L" hands to show the sides and bottom of an 
	I-Pad -- but that isn't a sign for I-pad, (and shouldn't be used as such) it 
	is just a
    <i>
     description of
    </i>
    an I-Pad, used for
    <font face="Arial">
     statements such as, "My I-pad was there on the table." Before using a 
	depictive verb (such as "L" hands showing what and I-pad looks like) you 
	generally still need to first identify the noun (the I-Pad).
     <br/>
