     To do the sign for "careful" place the right "K" hand on top of the left "K" hand. (If 
			you are right handed). 
  Keeping them together, move them forward, down, back, and up again in a 
  circular movement.  Use a "careful" facial expression.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     CAREFUL:

     Signing tip: Of the two common versions, the version with the rotating 
	movement means to "be careful" or to do something "carefully."

     The other version (the version that whacks the two hands together) tends to 
	mean "take care" (as in "Take care, see you later!") or "take care of" (as 
	in "I like to take care of plants."). There is a bit of overlap and quite a 
	bit of variation in usage by individual signers but the above is what I 
	recommend. However I wouldn't be surprised to see the "whack" version 
	eventually take on more of a "be careful" connotation (meaning) over time 
	due to the similarity in the "feel" of the sign to the sign WARN/warning/"to_caution."
