    Memory aid:  This sign is based on "the statue of the Pole best-known to 
Americans, General Kosciuszko, who was a strategist and tactician advising 
General Washington during the American Revolution, which depicts him as having a 
turned-up nose. As is often the case, the sign for an individual became the sign 
for the place that person is from." **(Bar-Tuzr)

    Memory aid: "The Poles' bravery in facing Russians and any other would-be

    Note: That handshape is a flattened "O".  If you search around online the 
overwhelming tendency of those sign languages that do this sign as a movement 
across the chest do so moving from the non-dominant side to the dominant side. 
Additionally the handshape for most of the examples was a flattened "O."  
Some signed languages (Spanish, Czech, Portuguese) use an "A" handshape, which, 
to me, seems much more clear. You may see other handshapes (such as a 
"bent-hand") but I recommend that if you are signing "ASL" you go with the 
traditional "ASL" sign ("A"-hand off the nose) or use the flattened-O version 
below after mentioning that it is the "indigenous" sign -- which is to say "the 
sign used by Deaf Poles (Polish people).  Indigenous means:
    "Originating or occurring naturally in a particular place; native" -- according 
to Google.
