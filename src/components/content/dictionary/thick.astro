     THICK (substance or quality)
     <br/>
     This is a
     <i>
      general
     </i>
     sign for "thick." It uses a "loose C-hand" 
	(or even a "claw" hand).
     <br/>
     Suppose you were telling a story about your grandma's
     <a href="/dictionary/soup">
      SOUP
     </a>
     and you wanted to say it was thick this would be a good sign to use.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     THICK (general version: the general quality or state of being thick / 
	especially certain liquid substances, soup, blood, paint, porridge, my 
	wife's makeup, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/thickd1.jpg" width="222"/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/thickd2.jpg" width="222"/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/thickd3.jpg" width="222"/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Note: The general version of "thick" (above) doesn't just apply to 
	certain types of food or 
	liquid. It is commonly used in situations where a more specific sign won't 
	work. For example I once saw a person use this version to mean "
     <a href="/dictionary/bold">
      bold
     </a>
     " 
	as in "
     <b>
      bold
     </b>
     face type."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Note: Yes, eventually I'll pay for that comment about my wife's makeup. 
	She'll find out. She always does.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     THICK (Two-handed version)
     <br/>

     <img border="0" height="320" src="/images/thick.14.jpg" width="309"/>
     <br/>
     The two-handed version means the same as the one-handed version.  There 
	is no need to use both hands for this sign. But for what it is worth, I 
	recall asking a friend of mine how he would sign "porridge" and he signed 
	THICK SOUP using the two-handed version of THICK.  My point here is 
	that if you see it done with two hands don't think that it is wrong. It is 
	just a variation.

     THICK (Version: The thickness of something vertical)

     THICK (Version: The thickness of something horizontal) (This is a depictive 
	sign. It is sometimes called CL:C or Classifier C).

    <p>
     Relatively thick, fairly thick, or somewhat thick.  Note the facial 
	expression:
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
   </font>
   <img border="0" height="320" src="/images/thick.71.jpg" width="285"/>
   <br/>
   The facial expression for the above sign as based on showing a "relatively 
	thick stack of papers." That mouth morpheme you are seeing means "fairly," 
	"relatively," "substantial but not overwhelming."  You might also see 
	it on signs like 'so-so."

    THICK-PIZZA: Deep Dish
    <font face="Arial">
     (THICK-CRUST)
     <br/>
     In context you can use a CL:C to indicate that the crust on a pizza is a 
	"thick" crust.
     <br/>
     First you indicate that you are talking about "pizza" then you indicate that 
	it is thick.
    </font>
    <br/>
    There are quite a few ways to sign
    <a href="/dictionary/pizza">
     PIZZA
    </a>
    .  
	Do one of them and then sign THICK.
    <br/>
    In my example (below) I'm spelling "pizza" using a lexicalized form that 
	overlaps the letters (note the second frame where the "P" and the "I" are 
	both visible at the same time) and uses the "double-Z" (based on a "V" hand 
	moving in a "Z" pattern).
    <br/>
    Then I use "C" handshapes to show how thick I want my pizza.  Okay, 
	sure, I'm hamming it up a bit here (because pizza gets me excited and I'm 
	showing you the size I want).  In ASL you've got to get used to using 
	your face or your stories will be boring.

    <img border="0" height="310" src="/images/thick.55.jpg" width="309"/>
    <br/>
    Note: The mouth morpheme for that "deep dish" pizza is "CHA" (as if I'm 
	saying "cha").

   <p>
    Sample sentence:  "Which do you prefer, thick or thin crust pizza?" 
	= "PIZZA THIN-[crust], THICK-[crust], WHICH FAVORITE-[prefer] YOU?"
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: You could make that sentence even "more" ASL by changing "WHICH PREFER 
	YOU" to "YOU PREFER WHICH YOU?" (or even drop the last YOU)
