     Hi Dr. Bill,
     <br/>
     I am a psychotherapist who took ASL for several years 
			... and now find myself in the position of working with a Deaf 
			couple, with no interpreter. Obviously this is not an ideal 
			situation, but lack of finances and such make it the best we can do 
			right now...
     <br/>
     One concept I have not been able to find a sign for is 
			the idea of "coping with" or "dealing with" an emotion or problem. 
			We therapists talk a lot about coping skills, but I'm not sure how 
			to sign about them! Any ideas? I'd love to be able to ask something 
			like "You got really angry - and then how did you cope with that?"
     <br/>
     Thanks for any thoughts you might have...
     <br/>

     Dear Jessica,
     <br/>
     Hello :)
     <br/>
     The ways to interpret "cope" or "deal with" are generally as 
			follows:
     <br/>
     1.
     <a href="/dictionary/patience">
      PATIENCE
     </a>
     :  Use the 
			sign for "patience."  You could sign. YOU PATIENCE THAT HOW?
     <br/>
     2.
     <a href="/dictionary/control">
      CONTROL
     </a>
     :  The sign for 
			"control" has many meanings, including: "manage, administer, reign, 
			and handle."  The sign for "control" could be used in many 
			situations similar to the English phrase, "How did you handle that?"  
			You could sign, "YOU CONTROL THAT HOW?"
    </p>
    <p>
     3.
     <a href="/dictionary/what-do">
      what-DO
     </a>
     :  The "what-DO" 
			sign can be combined with the YOU sign to mean, "What did you do?"
     <br/>
     - Cordially,
     <br/>
     Dr. Bill
     <br/>
