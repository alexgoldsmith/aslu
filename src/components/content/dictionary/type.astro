     The sign for "type" as in "Dr. Bill can type 94 words 
			per minute" is done by holding your hands out in front of you as if on a keyboard.  
			Wiggle your 
  fingers a bit as if typing on a keyboard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     TYPE / KEYBOARDING:
     <br/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/type.h28.jpg" width="243"/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/type.h29.jpg" width="243"/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/type.h30.jpg" width="243"/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/type.h31.jpg" width="243"/>
     <img border="0" height="228" src="/images/type.h28.jpg" width="243"/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <hr align="left" color="#000000" size="1"/>
    Note:  This sign doesn't mean "What type" as in "What kind of..." 
			-- instead see: "
    <a href="/dictionary/what-kind">
     WHAT KIND
    </a>
    "
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Note: If you want to sign "texting" (as in communicating via a smart 
			phone) do a mime movement that looks like you are holding a phone in 
			both hands (two slightly modfied "A" handshapes held together) and 
			moving your thumbs as if texting.
