    The main version uses "W" hands and moves them both downward using a wavy

      Hi again!! I know you have a lot of email that you must go through, but 
I just thought I would add something. My daughter and I down here in 
Florida learned the sign for weather as two "W"-handshapes, facing each 
other, and then you twist them around each other, like the sign for 
change. I also found this in an old "Joy of Signing" book. Is this ok to 
use, or is it an older sign? Thank you, and I hope you have a great 
weekend!!

      Monica,
      <br/>
      I consider the "change" version of "weather" to be one of the top 3 
versions of "weather." It is a very good sign.
I'd rank it as my "third" choice, but it is a solid sign that I'd defend 
as being just as good as any other choice. So if more people in a 
certain region are using that version than another version, I'd 
certainly go with that version.  One thing I'd caution you about 
though is that the version you are talking about generally doesn't twist 
the hands "around" each other, rather you just hold the pinkie and thumb 
of one hand near the pinkie and thumb of the other hand and use two 
small twisting movements.
      <br/>
      Cordially,
      <br/>

    Notes:
    <br/>
    <font face="Arial">
     It isn't as common, but on occasion I'll notice someone using the sign for "wind"
to mean "weather."  I don't recommend doing that. "WIND" is a fine sign 
and great to use for referring to movement of "air" but I just don't see a 
reason to use it as the sign for weather.
