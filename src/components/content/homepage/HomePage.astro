      Hello ASL Heroes! I'm glad you are here! You can learn ASL! You've picked
      a great topic to be studying. Signing is a useful skill that can open up
      for you a new world of relationships and understanding. I've been teaching
      American Sign Language for over 20 years and I am passionate about it. I'm
      Deaf/hh, my wife is d/Deaf, I hold a doctorate in Deaf Education / Deaf
      Studies. My day job is being a full-time tenured ASL Instructor at
      California State University (Sacramento).

      What you are learning here is important. Knowing sign language will enable
      you to meet and interact with a whole new group of people. It will also
      allow you to communicate with your baby many months earlier than the
      typical non-signing parent! Learning to sign even improves your brain!
      (Acquiring a second language is linked to neurological development and
      helps keep your mind alert and strong as you age.) It is my goal to
      deliver a convenient, enjoyable, learning experience that goes beyond the
      basics and empowers you via a scientifically engineered approach and
      modern methodologies that save you time & effort while providing maximum
      results. I designed this communication-focused curriculum for my own
      in-person college ASL classes and put it online to make it easy for my
      students to access. I decided to open the material up to the world for
      free since there are many parents of Deaf children who NEED to learn how
      to sign but may live too far from a traditional classroom. Now people have
      the opportunity to study from almost anywhere via mobile learning, but I
      started this approach many years ago -- way before it became the new
      normal. You can self-study for free (or take it as an actual course for
      $483. Many college students use this site as an easy way to support what
      they are learning in their local ASL classes.

      ASL is a visual gestural language. That means it is a language that is
      expressed through the hands and face and is perceived through the eyes. It
      isn't just waving your hands in the air. If you furrow your eyebrows, tilt
      your head, glance in a certain direction, lean your body a certain way,
      puff your cheek, or any number of other "inflections" --you are adding or
      changing meaning in ASL. A "visual gestural" language carries just as much
      information as any spoken language.There is much more to learning American
      Sign Language than just memorizing signs. ASL has its own grammar,
      culture, history, terminology and other unique characteristics. It takes
      time and effort to become a "skilled signer." But you have to start
      somewhere if you are going to get anywhere--so dive in and enjoy.
      Cordially. - Dr. Bill
