"Goodnight Moon" by Margaret Wise BrownIn the great green roomthere was a telephoneand a red balloonand a picture of...The cow jumping over the moonAnd there were three little bears sitting on chairsAnd two little kittens And a pair of mittensAnd a little toy house And a young mouseAnd a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mushAnd a quiet old lady who was whispering "hush"Goodnight room Goodnight roomGoodnight cow jumping over the moonGoodnight light and the red balloonGoodnight bears Goodnight chairsGoodnight kittens and Goodnight mittensGoodnight clocks and goodnight socksGoodnight little house and Goodnight mouseGoodnight comb and Goodnight brushGoodnight nobody Goodnight mushAnd Goodnight to the old lady whispering "hush"Goodnight stars Goodnight airGoodnight noises everywhere
