The sign for "high school" uses an "H" and a "modified" 
	S-hand.Spell "H" and then quickly change into an S-hand.(Don't worry if the "S" hand ends up sideways.)HIGH-SCHOOL:Note: Thearmdoesn't move. Just change the handshape from an "H" to 
	an "S" handshape.The "S" can either end up sideways (as a result of high-speed signing) or it 
	can end up in the more traditional orientation.Sample sentence: When did you graduate from high school?For your ASL class or during a test I recommend you sign it using 
	one of these ways:HIGH SCHOOL, YOU GRADUATE WHEN?  [This is an example of topicalization. 
	The "object" becomes the topic.]YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL WHEN?  [This is an example of using "YOU" as 
	the subject, followed by a verb and an object; then followed by a "WH"-type 
	question. ]One of the reasons we tend to put "WH"-type signs like "WHEN" at the end of 
	a sentence is so that we don't have to furrow our eyebrows as much. (Since 
	we usually furrow our eyebrows when asking "WH"-type questions: (WHO, WHAT, 
	WHEN, WHERE, WHICH, WHY, HOW, HOW-MANY)
