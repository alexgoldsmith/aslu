ASL: "Santa"The sign for Santa Claus is based on his bushy white beard. 
	Hold a loose "CLAW" hand to your chin.  Bring it down in an arc to your 
	chest and touch the pinkie finger side of your hand to your chest.SANTA CLAUS:Are there other ways to sign Santa Claus? Yes. There are quite a 
			few.  The one above is nice though since it is simple, it uses 
			only one hand (which lets me hold an eggnog in the other), and is 
			non-initialized (it doesn't use an "S" hand so people won't accuse 
			you of using Signed English, which, apparently would make you a bad 
			boy or girl and not get any presents).Notes:*
