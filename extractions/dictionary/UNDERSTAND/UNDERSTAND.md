		Your index finger is bent and 
  the tip of the index finger is touching the pad of your thumb (your 
  thumbprint).  Then flick your index finger so

	them what isthe rest of the sentencein which they want to use the concept 
	of "don't." The reason I need to know the rest of the sentence is because 
	there isn't just "one" sign for "don't." There are dozens of ways to express 
	the concept of "don't" in ASL.  Most of the time the concept is 
	"incorporated" into the movement of the sign and the facial expressions or 
	shaking of the head.For example, in the sign "don't understand" you express the concept of 
	"don't" by using a negative headshake:See:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_90JOGT0vfs(for a Youtube video clip of
