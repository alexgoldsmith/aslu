The concept of "add" can be done a couple of ways.Generally we either use the "plus" sign or the "add to" sign.ADD-to = "add" = "additionally" = "in addition to" 
	= "extra"PLUS:Note: This sign is also good for keeping the
  vampires away. I haven't been bitten once. (That I know of.)Note:Â  While I start with the right finger farther out than the left
  and then bring the right finger back (from "out to in") -- I've noticed thatmanyof my friends start with the right finger between their 
	chest and their left finger
  and then move their right finger forward until it touches the left finger.
