There are many, many ways to sign this concept.  It all depends on what 
  you mean.In general youmime the act of pulling whatever is being "pulled."The generic sign for pull uses "S"-handshapes and looks as if you are 
	holding onto a rope (extending out in front of you) with both hands. This 
	version could be used to mean "pull something towards me" or "pull on a 
	rope."PULL:If you mean "pull" as in "Pull a tooth" then use an "S"-handshape 
			near the mouth (as if holding a pair of pliers) and mime the act of 
			pulling a tooth.PULL-a-tooth:"Notes:Occasionally you may see the "pull on a rope" sign above used to 
			mean "pull" a person or group to your way of thinking, (as in, "We 
			will trip to pull him into our camp").  This is a somewhat 
			metaphorical use of the sign and is not "wrong" however you should 
			also make sure thatif you mean "pull" as in "influence" then you know 
			and can use the sign for "influence."
