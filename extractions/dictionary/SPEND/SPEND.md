This sign is generally done with one hand and means to "spend money."  
	To do it right, pretend you've got a quarter under your thumb.  As you move your 
    hand forward, slide the quarter forward and off your fingers as if sliding 
    it into a vending machine.)This is a great sign. 
    I recall watching a young man talk about his car.  That car was his 
    pride and joy. One complaint he had though was it was like a baby.  He 
    had to keep "feeding" it.  This is the sign he used for "feeding." What 
    he meant was he had to keep spending a lot of money on it.This same sign can be used to mean "nourish."
