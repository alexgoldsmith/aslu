The sign for "Deafhood" is a combination of the ASL sign DEAF and 
			the sign GUTS.(If you don't like the idea of calling that second part of the sign 
			"guts" you can think of it as being "that which is at my core."  
			So, you can think of this sign as meaning "Deaf at the core."  
			Or think of it as meaning "Deaf inside at a fundamental level."The sign DEAF touches the index finger to the cheek near the ear. 
			Then the finger lifts off of the cheek a bit and moves in a small 
			arc and touches the cheek again near the mouth.Then you sign "guts" by forming your hand into a "bent" handshape 
			and poking the side of your abdomen once or twice. (Since this is a 
			compound sign you should just touch the "guts" part of the sign 
			once.)DEAFHOOD:Note: Some people just sign DEAF and then spell hood. Some people 
			sign DEAF and then sign PRO-3-POSS+.  (That is a fancy way of 
			saying do the third person possessive pronoun and then do it an 
			additional time.  Or I could have typed "HIS-HIS" -- but that 
			is awkward when you are striving to be gender neutral in your 
			writing eh?)Animated gif: DEAFHOOD:Notes:"Deafhood" generally refers to a Deaf person's individual life 
			journey.Also see:DEAFNESSYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
