American Sign Language: 
"vitamin" or "vitamins"To express the concept of a vitamin or vitamins, just spell "VIT"VITAMIN:Notes:One day my daughter 
	Kelsey (around age 3 at the time) pointed to the medicine cabinet and did an interesting handshape/movement that 
	looked like:As it turned out, she was combining all three letters "V-I-T" into one 
	handshape with a fluttering pinkie. The fact that her handshape was a 
	combination of the English letters (VIT) didn't matter a bit to her.  
	What was important to her was that hersignrepresentedthe sweet-tasting 
	chewable children's vitamins in the medicine cabinet.  As a "Coda" 
	(child of Deaf adults), English was not a middleman 
	for her.  The connection in her mind between her sign and the vitamins 
	was direct.-Dr. Bill*
