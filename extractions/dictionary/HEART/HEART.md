The concept of "heart" can be expressed a couple of different 
			ways in ASL.A good general way is to poke your chest twice with the tip of the middle finger of  a modified 
  "five" hand  that has the middle finger bent at the large knuckle.If you just poke once using a somewhat larger movement it means "touched" as 
  in "I was touched by his generosity."Version two: Draw a heart shape on your chest with the tips of both index fingers.  
  Start at the top center of the heart.Version three:   Instead of using the tips of the index fingers to 
	draw a heart on your chest, 
  use the tips of the middle fingers of modified "five" hands that have the 
  middle fingers bent at the large knuckle.You can learn
