The sign for "battery" (as 
	in "I need a new hearing aid battery") is actually the same as the sign for 
	"electricity."  Your meaning is made clear by the rest of your sentence.To sign "electricity," use "X" handshapes. Tap (gently) the 
	knuckles together twice.ELECTRICITY = "battery"BATTERY:The sign for "electricity" can 
	also be used (in context) to mean "battery"Sample sentence: What kind of battery does your hearing aid use?= YOUR HEARING-AID BATTERY, YOU NOT-YET CHANGE YOU?There is an initialized version of "battery" that uses a "B" hand.  
This is a "Signed English" version of battery.  I see it being used from 
time to time with Deaf kids that use hearing-aids, but I really don't recommend 
using this sign. 
The "ASL way" 
to sign "battery" is to use the sign forelectricity.If you sign "HEARING-AID ELECTRICITY" it isobviousthat you are talking about a 
"hearing-aidbattery." So there usually no real need to ever use 
the initialized version of "battery" shown below.BATTERY: (initialized version) (not recommended)
