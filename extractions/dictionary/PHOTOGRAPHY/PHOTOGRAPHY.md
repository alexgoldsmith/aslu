The sign for "photography" is based on the sign "take a 
picture." The sign "PHOTOGRAPHY" is the same sign as 
"take-a-PICTURE" and/or "CAMERA" but the 
meaning is generally made clear via context."Take a picture." (photography)CAMERA:"A photograph or picture"See:CAMERASee:PICTUREAnne writes:"Hello Dr. Vicars,I have been looking around through different sites including lifeprint, and 
have not been able to find a sign for "photography" if it exists at all. I'm 
new to ASL and am learning through an online course for school. In one of my 
assignments, I'm required to tell a bit about myself, including some of my 
hobbies, one being photography. How would I sign "I like photography"?- AnneDear Anne,Just point at your self and then indicate that you like taking pictures.  
I you note in the example below that I repeat the subject pronoun at the end 
of the sentence.  It isn't required to repeat the subject pronoun in 
this situation, but I notice that is how I do it when I "practice" the 
sentence to myself. I also add a bit of a nod on that last "I/me" sign.- Dr. Bill"I like photography"  = "I/me LIKE take-PICTURE I/me"
