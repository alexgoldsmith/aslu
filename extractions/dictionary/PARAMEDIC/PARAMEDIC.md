Subject: Sign for ParamedicHi Dr. Bill,If you get a chance, can you tell me if the sign for 'paramedic' is 
			thesame as the sign for 'hospital', but with a 'p' hand shape?Thank you,- Heather LoweDear Heather,I wouldnotdo a cross on the shoulder to mean paramedic 
			because that wouldconflictwith the sign for "patient." (As 
			in a "hospital patient.")If you need to sign "paramedic"I would recommend tapping 
			the tip of the middle finger of the "P" hand twice on the 
			non-dominant wrist.- Dr. BillDr. Bill,Oh, like 'd' on the wrist for doctor, but 'p' for paramedic. That 
			makes sense.My ASL study group was wondering about this so I'll pass the sign on 
			to them.Thank you very much,-  Heather LoweSee:DOCTORSee:HOSPITALSee:PATIENT (Scroll down on the "Patient" 
			page to see the medical version done on the shoulder.)You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
