The right sign for "right" depends on what concept you 
			are trying to convey.The English word "right" can be signed
  many different ways in ASL depending on its meaning.RIGHT / CORRECT / ACCURATE:As in, "You are right."The dominant index-finger hand comes down onto the non-dominant index finger 
	hand.RIGHT-direction:Opposite of "left."  "On the right-hand side"RIGHT-(alright/rights)
	(single movement)Used in concepts like:"It is your right.""I'm alright!" (definite)"Alright, go ahead."RIGHT-(alright/rights)(double movement)Used in concepts like:Deaf people have "rights."Are you "alright?""I'm alright." (for the most part)Notes:I tend to see the double motion when people mean
  "rights" plural.   When they mean "right"
  singular I see the single movement.In response to "How are you?" -- if I'm feeling really good I'll sign 
	"ALRIGHT" using a single strong movement.  If I'm feeling sort of 
	alright I'll sign "ALRIGHT" using a double movement and a "so so" facial 
	expression.I use the double movement if someone is sick or having a hard time and I want 
	to gently ask someone if they are
  "alright."  If someone slipped and fell and I want to ask more 
	urgently then I'll use a single movement done with more force.Additionally if I'm signing either fast or casually I tend to drop the 
	double movement and just sign it using a single movement.The sign "alright" is indeed also used to mean "rights."The rest of the sentence and small changes in production help us to 
		distinguish the meaning."Are you alright?" =  Tilt head slightly forward, raise eyebrows, hold 
		last sign a bit longer: YOU RIGHT-(alright) YOU?"You have the right to vote." Standard version = Nod head: YOU HAVE 
		RIGHT-(alright) VOTE YOU."You have the right to vote." Topicalized version = VOTE? YOU HAVE 
		RIGHT-(alright) YOU.In general the movement of the sign RIGHT-(alright) is a singular 
		movement but it is inflected at times.If you are being emphatic you can use a larger single movement that 
		comes way off of the base hand:  It's your right!If you are being gentle you can use a smaller double movement that 
		doesn't leave the palm of the base hand: "Are youalright?"If you need to pluralize "rights" you can use a slightly larger double 
		movement: "People have rights."See:ALRIGHTYou can learn
