The right sign for "get" depends on your meaning.The generic sign "GET" starts with your hands in loose, open, claw shapes
held away from the body.Pull your hands back towards 
	your bodyand change 
	them so they become "S" hands.GET/acquire / receive / obtain:Sample sentence: "Where does milk come from? How do we get it?"Notes:If you want to say something like "I finally got it" or "it occurred to me 
suddenly" you would not use the sign "GET" instead you'd use the sign "HIT."Â  
This is also true for a situation in which a person
suddenly came down with the flu as in, "I got hit with the flu last
weekend."HIT:Also If you are going to sign "The boy got sick" you could use the sign 
	"become."See:BECOME
