AT:To do the sign for "at" as in the symbol @ that is commonly used in email 
	addresses use an "A" handshape and circle it in the air as if drawing the 
	symbol:@It really isn't an issue if you do the movement clockwise or 
	counterclockwise.I've yet to see a consensus on that. But in general it is standard to draw 
	and show things from your own perspective, so that is the way I do it.Warning!This next 
	version israrelyused in ASL.It is NOT used in phrases like "at least."Instead of signing "AT" in "atleast you can" you would sign 
	something like, "YOU STILL CAN ..." or "MINIMUM (version)."Instead of signing "atlast" you would sign "pah" 
	(finally).Instead of signing "We will meetatmy home tomorrow," you would 
	sign, TOMORROW MEET MY HOME.Instead of signing "Whereat?"Â  You would just sign "WHERE?" and 
	use an appropriate question facial expression.I'm showing the version below not so you will use it, but rather so you canrecognizeit if you see it.AT:
