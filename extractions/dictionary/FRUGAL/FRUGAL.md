Dr. Vicars,Thank you so much for being a wonderful resource for those of use that 
		want to learn more about ASL.Recently, had a situation on which I would like clarification:A man was talking about "freelance" terps and used the sign that is 
		the "middle finger" alternated off the chin....several laughed...his 
		comment was that, freelancers always poor/scatching to make ends 
		meet...so that is why the sign is appropriate...i have seen a signed 
		concept close to that for honeymoon.I have seen and use this sign for "free-lance" interpreter, i am just 
		not sure why this would be funny....because it is closely related to 
		another sign???John Hancock
