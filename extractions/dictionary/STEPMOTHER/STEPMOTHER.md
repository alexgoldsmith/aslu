	got an email from Dr. Lisalee Egbert mentioning that she uses the one-handed version for 
	both step-mother and stepfather.Notes from Dr. Bill regarding the "one finger variation" of STEP-FATHER and 
	STEP-MOTHER:A "one movement/one location" sign has anadvantageover a "two movement/two 
	location" sign since the single movement sign has "economy" in its favor. 
	The "one finger" sign is a strong variation in some parts of the country and 
	I think it is actually increasing in popularity.  I can certainly see 
	why Dr. Egbert would use it and I think it is a terrific sign. For me 
	personally though I think I'll still stick with the "second hand" version of 
	"stepfather/stepmother" as the version I teach my own classes.  Also 
	remember the "safest" version will likely be to spell STEP when used  
	as part of the sign for "stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, etc."
