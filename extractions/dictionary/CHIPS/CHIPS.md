I recommend you just spell C-H-I-P-S.Note: It is common to drop the "S."  For example you'll see 
			people signPOTATOand then spell C-H-I-P to ask if you want some "potato chips."CHIPS:Fingerspelled "C-H-I-P-S" 
  animation:CHIPS:  (Variation)It is 
  based on concept of the right hand thumb representing a knife or peeler and 
  the left hand representing a potato.  Make two quick downward and forward 
  movements as if you were slicing a potato to make chips.  The thumb 
  scrapes along the back of the "palm-down" left fist.See "CHIPS" - 
  (version) animatedAlso see:POTATONotes:When I was younger I used to 
	think that the "CHIPS" sign above was just a made up sign we used around the Vicars house, 
	otherwise known as a "home-sign."  It was useful for one of our 
  daughters, Sarah, who doesn't have any joints in her fingers. (Sort of hard to 
  fingerspell words like "C-H-I-P-S" when you can't bend your fingers.)It is fairly common for Deaf households 
	to come up with "home signs" to refer to things that may not have commonly 
	recognized signs outside of the home. (Note: I don't recommend Hearing 
	people "invent" signs because Hearing people who are not immersed in the 
	culture tend to create home-signs that conflict with existing 
	signs and/or are embarrassingly inappropriate. When in doubt whether a sign 
	is offensive or not -- ask a Deaf person.)I originally posted the variation of the sign for CHIPS here 
  with an explanation that it was a "home-sign" so that people could appreciate the fact that this language came into 
  being as a direct result of people adapting to their circumstances. Back 
	then, (when I first posted it) I figured it would be unlikely 
  to see this sign done outside my home.  I posted, "Who knows?  Maybe it will catch on?"Well it seems many others have also "came up with this sign" and/or it has 
	spread very quickly.   See below.-- Dr. Bill--------------------------In a message dated 10/26/2007

	the Deaf, Fremont.But instead of using an "S" hand (fist) for the base hand, she was using an 
	index finger for the base hand and using the "C" hand as the moving, 
	dominant hand.  I'll stick with the "S" and "C" variation for now, but
