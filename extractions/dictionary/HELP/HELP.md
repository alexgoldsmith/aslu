separate signs for "ME" and "YOU.""he-HELP-me"If you are talking to someone in front of you and start the sign off to the 
right of you and bring it nearer to you it means, "he-HELP-me.""he/she-HELP-him/her""you-HELP-me"If you start the sign near the other person and bring it toward yourself it 
means:  "You help me." If you do it with raised eyebrows, "Will you help 
me?"Example: "Would you mind helping me tomorrow?"= TOMORROW you-HELP-me you-MIND?
