The sign for "experience" is based on the idea of 
			stroking a beard.The version of the sign I'm doing below shows a somewhat exaggerated movement.
  (Pulling the sign down further than normal.)  The more you exaggerate
  this sign indicates more experience.EXPERIENCE:Memory aid:  Think of an old man with a white
  beard stroking the beard as he reflects on his lifeexperienceto solve some
  sort of problem. Older people have a lot of experience.Note: If you see someone do the sign "EXPERIENCE" using a criss-cross 
			pattern (down as normal and then doing a crosswise forward stroke 
			(the flat of the fingernails are dragged across the cheek toward the 
			front) it means "veryfamiliar with."You can learn
