The general sign for "dentist" combines the sign TOOTH and 
	PERSON-agent.DENTIST (TOOTH + PERSON-agent)Note: In context you can drop the "PERSON-agent" sign and just sign "TOOTH."  
	You use a double motion as if tapping your tooth twice -- but you don't 
	actually make contact with the tooth.  For example, if you sign "I/me 
	GO TOOTH" it is obvious that you are saying that you are going to the 
	"dentist."Note: A lot of people "initialize" the sign DENTIST by doing it with a "D" 
	hand. If you do that version, you should not add the PERSON-agent sign.  
	I don't recommend using the initialized version since the traditional ASL 
	sign is very easily recognized.Another version of "dentist" is to hit (lightly) the side of your mouth a couple times with the pinkie-side of
  your fist.Sample sentence:
	"How often do you go to the dentist?" = YOU GO DENTIST HOW OFTEN?"
