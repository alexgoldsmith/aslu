The sign for "Olympics" is based on the sign for "chain" which in 
			turn is based on the "connect" sign (which also means such things as 
			"of," "join," "member of," and "link.")OLYMPICS = "chain"Notes:In normal everyday usage in a sentence signed between two fluent 
			adults you only use "two" links (or "two" movements"). Sometimes you 
			might see this sign done with three links but generally three links 
			would be used only on first reference to introduce the topic to the 
			conversation. For example, visualize an elementary school teacher 
			getting the attention of her students and then excitedly signing "We 
			are going to discuss the Olympics today!"  I'd use the "QUOTE" 
			sign and spell the word Olympics on first usage followed by the sign 
			for CHAIN.  Example: "TODAY MAKE DISCUSS QUOTE O-L-Y-M-P-I-C-S 
			CHAIN!"  Upon second reference there would be no point in 
			wasting the effort to make three movements.Also see:DeaflympicsYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
