The sign for "sleep" is
    made by opening your hand and placing it in front of your face, palm toward
    you.  Move your hand downward toward your chin.  While the hand is moving, bring your fingers together and touch them with your
    thumb.SLEEP:Note: Youdon'tactually touch your chin. Your hand ends upin 
	front ofyour chin (or even lower).  This DOESN'T use a "fist" or 
	"S" hand.  It uses a flattened-"O" handshape similar to the ending 
	handshape of the "AND" sign.See:sleep-inSee:sleepy
