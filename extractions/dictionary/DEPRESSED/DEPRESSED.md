DEPRESSED:Down as in "depressed."  
Feeling down.  This sign bends the middle fingers forward at the large 
knuckle. It can but doesn't have to touch the body. Use a single straight down 
movement and an appropriately sad facial expression:Note: If you are feeling depressed I've been told that going to a brightly lit 
store is a good way to cheer up. All the bright light helps your biochemistry to 
cause you to cheer up.
