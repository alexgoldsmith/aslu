The sign for "holiday" Is the same sign as "vacation."I've noticed though that I tend to do vacation using a single movement when 
  I'm talking about "time off" orSPRING"break."For the sign "holiday" I use a double movement.Poke your upper chest area twice with the thumb tips of your relaxed 5-hands.HOLIDAY:See:Animation: "HOLIDAY"Notes:The sign “VACATION” can be used to 
  mean:* Holiday* “OFF” (work)* Break (time off).If you initialize the sign VACATION with an “R” or do it with just the 
  index and thumb, it can mean “retired”Also see:HOLLYWOODYou can learn
