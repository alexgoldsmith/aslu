The sign for limousine is done by signing "CAR" 
			(to establish what is being discussed) and then doing the sign for 
			"long-CAR" while using a slightly intense facial expression.CAR:Note that I'm establishing context by establishing "CAR" as my topic 
			by using raised eyebrows.After it is clear that you are talking about a "car," (either from 
			context or having used the CAR sign) hold bothslightlyflattened "C" hands in front of you, a bit off to 
			your dominant side, at about shoulder height and pull your dominant 
			hand back toward your shoulder and your non-dominant hand forward using a relatively quick, firm 
			stretch movement ending with solid hold. Often you will see quite a 
			bit of facial intensity as a way of emphasizing that it is abig 
			fancycar.long-CAR:Usage notes: The other day I watched a fellow tell a story about a 
			limo traveling up a long winding road to get to a ski resort.  
			The signer used slightly flattened "C" handshapes held about 8 
			inches apart and moved them in unison forward and side to side 
			pointed slightlyupwardto depict the limo moving along a mountain road. To get the hand 
			position right, imagine holding a 2 x 4 piece of lumber on your shoulder.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
