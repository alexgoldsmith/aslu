At my school we have a pre-school class with students that use 
        sign.  We need the signs for Mole,  Badger,  &  
        Hedgehog.    Also could you recommend a good sign 
        language dictionary (computer disk or book) for us to use.
        THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE MEJolene S.Guthrie Center Elem. School
