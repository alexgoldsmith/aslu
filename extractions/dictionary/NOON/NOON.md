Here is the "formal" sign for "noon." Noon is done with a flat hand 
			pointing upward and resting on the back of the non-dominant hand.NOON:Memory aid: Think of the dominant hand as the "sun" and the 
			non-dominant arm as the horizon.Note: The sign "NOON" is often done as it is above but you sign the 
			number 12 instead of using a flat hand.Sample sentence:TOMORROW EAT NOON, YOU WANT SOUP AND SALAD? (Would you like soup and salad for 
lunch tomorrow?)Also see:LUNCHYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
