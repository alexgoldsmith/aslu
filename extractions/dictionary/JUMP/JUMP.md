American Sign Language: 
		"jump"The sign for "jump" depends on your 
meaning and who or what is doing the jumping.  A needle on a meter jumping 
is signed much differently than a human being jumping.  A "cow 
jumping over the moon" is signed much differently than a little bird hopping 
around.The generic sign for jump is to use an upside down "V" to represent what it 
looks like when a person jumps:JUMP:JUMP (generic):Notes:Don't use the generic two-legged 
"JUMP" sign (above) for concepts other than standard human or primate jumping or 
leaping. If you want to sign "My heart jumped" then use a flutter motion near 
your heart. If you want to sign "Dad helped me jump my car (battery)," Then do a 
mime type motion (instrument classifier) showing the attaching of the jumper 
cables (the thumb, index, and middle fingers latch on to imaginary battery 
posts).Suppose you were talking about a horse riding competition and needed to indicate 
that the horse jumped over something. You would use a two handed version of the 
the sign "jump."JUMPED: (4-legged 
animal)*
