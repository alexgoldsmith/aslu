American Sign Language:  "Honey, 
I shrunk the audience."Honey, I shrunk the audience:Note: This video is in "Flash" format.  You may need to enable a plugin to 
view it.Signing note: The concept of "honey" as used in this sentence is simply a way 
for someone to "get the attention" of someone they love and have a close 
relationship. Thus even though (for fun) I'm using the sign for "honey" (as in 
bee honey), a good ASL interpretation of "honey" for this sentence would be more 
along the lines of using the up and down "hand wave" gesture while using a 
sweet, worried, apologetic facial expression.*
