A asks:Dr. Bill,Is there a sign for "acquaintance?" I am wondering because I have 
			one Deaf friend (I consider her a very good friend) and several Deaf 
			acquaintances.- GraceDear Grace,There is no "one" specific, widely recognized sign for 
			"acquaintance."If you mean "acquaintance" as in "someone you know and associate" 
			but not necessarily a friend, you could sign "I KNOW HIM."In your situation you could sign I HAVE ONE good-FRIEND DEAF. I KNOW 
			SEVERAL OTHER DEAF.If you mean "acquaintance" as in "nice to make your acquaintance..." 
			then sign "NICE MEET-you."- Dr. BillSee:FRIENDYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
