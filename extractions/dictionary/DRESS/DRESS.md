American Sign Language:  "dress"DRESS: The sign for "a dress" uses 
the "5 handshape on each hand." The sign starts at the upper chest (either very 
close to the body or actually touching the upper chest area with your thumbs). 
Use a downward brushing movement as if showing the way a dress hangs on your 
body.*
