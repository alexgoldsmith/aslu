American Sign Language: 
		"noise"The sign for noise in ASL is done by 
pointing to (or touching) your ear and then shaking your hands a couple of 
times.NOISES:"Last night the thunder and lightening was very loud and noisy!"Note: If you ask ten different people to sign this sentence for you you will 
	invariably getten different answers.  How do I know?  I've 
	asked many dozens of people to sign it.  For what it is worth, I'll 
	show you my variation.Note  the difference between "noisy" and "thunder."Notes:  I sign "PAST / before" to mean "last" inthissentence.For THUNDER, I point to the ear then I use a firm converse double movement 
	with both hands using "handshape: 5."For LIGHTENING, I make a downward  zigzagging movement with index 
	fingers.For "very" I did the sign "OOH" which uses an intense facial expression and 
	the dominant hand in a claw shape making shaking movement in front of the 
	lower face.For LOUD, I point to the ear then I use a firm converse double movement with 
	two hands using "handshape: S" on each hand.For NOISY, I point to the ear then I use a simultaneous twisting movement of 
	both hands using "handshape: 5."If you wanted, you could have a lot of fun and/or get into a lot of heated 
	arguments over the "right way" to do the sentence:  "Last night the 
	thunder and lightening was very loud and noisy!" Realistically though, there 
	is nooneright way -- just a lot of varying ways. What I've shown 
	you above are some "good ways" that should fill your need until you find a 
	"better way."Good luck  :)Also see:LOUD*
