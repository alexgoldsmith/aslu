There are several "right" ways to 
sign "AFTER." The right choice depends on the situation. Make sure to learn the 
first two main versions:"ACROSS/over/after" and "AFTER/from-then-on."The main version of the sign AFTER has mutated to be done exactly like the sign "ACROSS."  
You will see a lot of people signing phrases like: "ACROSS WORK I GO STORE. NEED 
ANYTHING?" to mean "I'm going to be stopping at the store after work.

The base hand is stationary.AFTER:This version of "after" is good for concepts like "from now on," "from then on,"

FINISH AFTER-[FROM-THEN-ON] what-DO YOU? (What did you do after school 
yesterday?)Of course, you could (and often should) just sign "FINISH" 
in many sentences involving the concept of "after."  For example, "WORK 
FINISH,#DO-DOYOU?" Would be an ASL way of saying, "What are you doing after work?"FINISH:
