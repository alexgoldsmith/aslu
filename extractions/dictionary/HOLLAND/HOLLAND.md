There are a couple of signs for "Holland." Both are 
			well known in the American Deaf Community.  I used to use the 
			two-handed (hat) version as my main version but then I realized I 
			couldn't eat a sandwich and sign Holland at the same time. So, 
			making the only logical choice I switched to the one-handed (pipe) 
			version and have been much happier and fulfilled ever since.Version 1: Hold a "Y" hand in front of your face and then move it 
	down, forward, and back up again in an arc. Memory aid: Think of someone 
	from Holland smoking a pipe.HOLLAND:The other version of "Holland" is based on the traditional (old) 
	Holland-style hat.Start with modified-"C"-hands on either side of your head and change them to 
	flattened "O" hands as you move both hands out (to your sides) in a small 
	arc.Holland:  (Version 2)You can learn
