If you mean "punch" as in "hit someone," then just throw a short 
			punch (mime it, don't actually hit someone -- unless you really mean 
			it. No, wait. Don't hit anyone. We live in a litigious society.)If you mean "punch" as in a diabetes inducing beverage then use the 
			sign forDRINK.  So, you could 
			sign FRUIT DRINK and it would be interpreted as "fruit punch."  
			If for some strange reason you need to indicate that it is an actual 
			"fruit drink" (as in a blended fruit drink) you could sign TRUE 
			FRUIT (as in "real fruit").DRINK:The above version is definitely a verb form.  (See how the 
			movement is a bit exaggerated?)  To do it as part of the 
			compound "fruit punch" you do a much smaller, quicker movement 
			(without the eye gaze).If you mean "punch" as in "punch a ticket" you should start with a 
			loose "C"-hand and quickly change it to an "S"-hand then relax the 
			hand (as if you were holding a hole punch and punched a ticket).  
			Yes, yes, I know it iscomplex, but practice a bit and you'll 
			get it.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
