Even though you see a "T" for the 
handshape this sign is commonly thought of as meaning "bathroom."  Yes, the 
sign for toilet is the same sign as "bathroom," but when you see it signed in a 
sentence you should usually interpret it as bathroom rather than toilet.The sign for "bathroom" is made by forming the right hand into the letter "t."  
The palm side is facing away from you. Shake your hand side to side a couple 
times. Some people use a twisting movement instead of the side to side shake.  
Either is fine, but I prefer the side to side shake. (heh)BATHROOM / toiletNote:To ask, "Do you need to go to the bathroom?"  (A frequent question in 
households with children and/or developmentally disabled folks), just tilt your 
head forward a bit, raise your eyebrows, and do the "toilet" sign."Do you need to go to the bathroom?"In

I refer to your site every day as well as go through the self-study units.I teach young children and one of things they often forget to do is flush the 
toilet. :)We wanted a way to tell them without verbally having to remind them ALL the 
time. If I had to guess, I would say the sign is similar to the gesture you 
would use when actually flushing the toilet. But I just wanted to verify. Thank 
you for your time!Sincerely,Anne NeumannAnne,That is correct, just grab an imaginary toilet handle and twist it in a flushing 
motion.:)-- Bill
