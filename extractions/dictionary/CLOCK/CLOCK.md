CLOCK:The sign for "clock" is a combination of the sign for "time" and using a 
classifier to show the general size and shape of a clock.  You can modify 
the classifier to show different types of clocks.  For example I generally 
use "C" hands to show a typical desk clock. But if I'm referring specifically to 
a clock up on the wall I generally use modified (rounded) "L" hands since wall 
clocks tend to be much thinner than desk clocks. A "wall clock" is basically a 
"dish" on the wall. So you would sign "TIME"+"dish on the wall" to mean wall 
clock. :)See:TIMENotes:Also see: "ASL
