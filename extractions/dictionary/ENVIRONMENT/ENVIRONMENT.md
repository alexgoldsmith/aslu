if you are in a bilingual / bicultural environment wherein both English and ASL 
are being used -- such as a mainstream high-school classroom with an ASL 
interpreter. For example an interpreter upon first usage of the concept 
"environment" in a conversation or discussion may choose to use the initialized 
sign for "ENVIRONMENT" as well as show the non-initialized version.  Upon 
subsequent usage in the same conversation or lecture the interpreter might tend 
to use only the non-initialized version as long as there are no overlapping / 
related concepts being expressed by the English speaker (environment / situation 
/ circumstance / condition / ambiance, etc.).If the lecture involves several related concepts, the interpreter or signer may 
be more likely to use the initialized version to make it clear which concept is 
being expressed.Other initialized versions of this sign are "CASE / 
CONDITION / CIRCUMSTANCE" as well as "SITUATION."ENVIRONMENT: Initialized version:
