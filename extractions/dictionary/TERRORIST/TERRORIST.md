			FOR-FOR? POLITICAL INFLUENCE.Prior to deciding on and promoting a sign for "terrorism" we must first consider if we have a sign for "violence" -- 
			since terrorism is the use of violence to intimidate, or coerce, (generally for political purposes).  
			Lacking consensus on a good sign for "violence" (DESTROY? FIGHT? RUIN/harm/spoil?) we then take another approach:  
			Terrorists cause "terror." But I doubt many signers would support the idea of using "SCARED+PERSON" to mean terrorist.At some point we have to decide, are we willing to use a version of the sign "terrible" and justify it by saying 
			terrorists do "terrible" things and therefore the compound TERRIBLE-PERSON would mean terrorist?  And 
			"TERRIBLE-ACTION" would mean "terrorism."--Dr. Billp.s. One of the people I interviewed regarding how to sign this 
			concept signed "terrorist" by miming the act of pulling a ski-mask 
			over his face. I thought that was averyinteresting (and 
			highly visual) way to sign terrorist.TERRIBLE:Also see:VIOLENCEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
