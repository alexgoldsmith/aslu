Various locationsTo sign "bottom" hold the dominant hand about six inches below the 
	non-dominant hand.The non-dominant hand doesn't move. The dominant hand does a down-up-down 
	patting movement. The movement is in the wrist.Think of "patting the bottom of a box."Some people "circle" the dominant hand, but to me that means 
  "below/basic/beneath."BOTTOM:Compare:  "BASEMENT"To sign "top," form both hands into flat hands.  Hold the non-dominant 
	hand (generally) vertical.  Then use the dominant hand to pat the "top" 
	of the non-dominant hand twice.  In my example below I wish I had held 
	my left hand a bit more vertical, but then again this might be a good time 
	to point out that there is a "citation" version of a sign (the full, pretty, 
	complete, carefully enunciated version) and the "casual" (sloppy, 
	half-formed, lazy) way that most of us Deaf actually do sign on a daily 
	basis.TOP:"on the LEFT side"The movement for this sign is similar to patting a wall on your left. Pat it 
  twice with your fingers. The movement is in the wrist (not the arm).Click for an for an animation of:"on the left side""on the right side"The movement for "on the right side" is as if you were patting a wall on 
	your right. It is an awkward little sign but it still the one we use.Animation: "on the right side"Also see:RIGHTYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
