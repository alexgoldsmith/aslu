American Sign Language:  "dandelion"DANDELION:Left index finger points straight up (palm faces right); the finger represents 
the stem of the flower. Hold left hand stationary. Fingertips of right flat O 
hand shape touch finger pad of left finger (right palm faces down). (this is 
almost like signing 'word'. but with a flat O hand shape instead). Now, blow on 
right hand and at the same time, open it to a 5 hand shape (palm faces you) and 
move it off to the right and as you do, flutter all the fingers.   (Description contributed by Lyn J. Wiley)*
