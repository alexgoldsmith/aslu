Notes:  "Aloha" is used in spoken Hawaiian  as a greeting or 
    farewell.Thus it is the equivalent of both hello and good-bye.In ASL we just wave hello and good-bye.So far my contacts in Hawaii tell me that they just use a 
	big wave of the "five" hand to say ALOHA.  One of my friends "made up" 
	a sign that starts with wave with an "A" handshape.  But from what I 
	can tell, that sign hasn't spread, and so I can't really recommend it.  
	For now, just smile and do a rainbow-like wave with the palm forward.
