American Sign Language:  "early"EARLY:Both hands keep the same handshape throughout the sign.  The right hand 
slides over the left hand.Memory aid: Think of the sun's rays coming over the horizon "early" in the 
morning.Note: The base hand can be either a fist or a flat hand.Note: The middle finger is sliding over the back of the non-dominant hand ("slideit" don't "flick it").#EARLY:  "lexicalized version"This version of the sign spells out the letters of "early." I notice when I do 
the sign I leave out the letter "A." I also blur my "R" and "L" together. I also 
tend to trace a counterclockwise circle (from the signer's perspective) in the 
air.  You might see other variations, but the point is lots of people do a 
"fingerspelled" version of #EARLY.Notes:In a message dated 7/29/2014, Scott from archildrens.org (Arkansas Children's 
Hospital) writes:Dr. Vicars,...I wanted to let you know (in case any of your ASL heroes travel to Arkansas) 
I ran across a funny southern dialect for "waking up early." They do not use the 
traditional "EARLY." It's common to see "rooster" 
instead. I definitely wouldn't recommend signing this normally, but to be aware!
