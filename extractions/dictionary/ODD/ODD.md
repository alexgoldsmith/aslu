ODD-(opposite of even)When referring to "odd and even" numbers just spell the 
  concepts: O-D-D / E-V-E-N.Some people do the sign "EQUAL" to 
			mean "even."The term "odd" can be expressed by using the sign for "STRANGE" but 
if you are 
      talking about "odd numbers" I recommend justspellingO-D-D.STRANGE:Sample sentence:
			"Do you like try strange new food?" = FOOD, STRANGE NEW, YOU LIKE 
			EAT?Notes:STRANGER: Many people use the sign STRANGE with the "PERSON 
			/ AGENT" sign to mean, 
  "stranger."  This usage is contested by and not approved by 
			some ASL instructors.Another approach to signing "stranger" is to use the signs "NEW"-"PERSON-(agent)" to mean 
  "stranger."Yet another approach is to use the construction of 
			your sentence to create the desired meaning.For example: YESTERDAY PRO-1 INDEX-[at] WORK HAPPENSOMEONE!MAN CL:1-"walked_past_quickly" I NEVER SEE PRO-3 BEFORE.  That 
			sentence (gloss) would be 
			generally mean: "Yesterday at work a stranger (some guy I've never 
			seen before) rushed past me.Also see:STRANGEAlso see:WEIRDYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
