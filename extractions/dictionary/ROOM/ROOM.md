	for "box." Use flat hands to show the sides and then bent hands to show the 
	front and back of the room or box.ROOM (or "box" -- depending on context)Note: The sign ROOM is based on the concept of "a box." Thus this sign can 
	be interpreted as either "room" or "box" depending on context to make your 
	meaning clear.There is also an initialized form of the sign ROOM that uses "R" handshapes, 
	it isnotrecommended.Â There is generally no need to ever initialize the the 
	sign for "ROOM" with "R"-hands since context makes it clear what you mean.The "R"-hands version is considered to be "Signed English."The FLAT-hands into BENT-hands version of "room" also works better (slightly 
	faster and easier to do) for compound signs such as:BEDROOM.Also see:BOXAlso see:OFFICE
