		Canadian ASL dictionary from the library and it said to finger-spell
		it!) So.... hold the initial F hand out to the side (as on a bird's 
		wing) and swoop it gently back and forth and slightly downward each 
		time. I was very taken with this sign as it seemed so appropriate, so I
		wanted to share it with you. And, in so doing, check that there isn't
		some other meaning for this gesture that we novices don't know.Reina,That is a great sign you have come up with.You may be glad to know that it is one of three variations that I support.1.  "F" hand floating downward, side to side, in the manner of a falling 
	feather.2.  Closed G-hand up near the side of your head, changes into a wide "G" 
	hand as it moves up and then changes back into a closed "G-hand" as if showing a feather in a head-dress worn by 
	a Native American.3.  Two closed "G" hands holding the base of a feather. The dominant hand moves up 
	and to the side at an angle as it changes into an "open-G hand" and back 
	into a closed G-hand as if showing the shape of a feather.Bill
