To sign "ice-cream" hold an "S" hand in front of your mouth and move it 
	downward twice as if you were licking an ice-cream cone.ICE-CREAM:See:Animation: ICE-CREAMNOTES:Youdon'tactually stick out your tongue in a true-to-life 
  licking movement.  If you do, that would inflect the sign to mean 
  something to the effect of "She took two big licks."  If you 
			are telling a story and that is what you want to say (She took two 
			big licks..." then fine -- you can stick out your tongue).But typically you will just see the sign done in one of three ways:1)  Slightly mouth the words ice-cream2)  Don't use any mouth movement3)  Use two very, very slight licking movements with the tongueI've seen the sign for "ice-cream" done all three ways bynativeDeaf signers.  
  I do it in my example above with no mouth movement.  I just asked my wife 
			(Deaf) how she signs 
  it and she partially mouthed "ice cream."  I showed her the version with 
  two small licks and she didn't like that versionat all, but she 
			thought the no-mouth-movement version was "okay." If you see it a 
			certain way in your area then certainly do itthatway. 
			Better yet, just send me a coupon for Baskin Robbins so I can do 
			some more research on this topic.Also see:CAKEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
