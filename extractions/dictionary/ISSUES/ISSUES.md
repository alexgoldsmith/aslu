Notice, I'm not rolling my eyes upwards and smirking.  This 
			version of this sign simply means "issues," "subjects," or "topics." 
			It is meant to be a factual, straightforward reference to "issues" 
			in general.ISSUES:Note: If I did the sign without changing the location (keeping it 
			right in front of me) andsmirked, then yes, this sign could 
			be used in a condescending way.Also see:QUOTEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
