American Sign 
	Language: "street / way / path / road"STREET:This one sign means street, way, path, and road.Notes:*  Compare the sign "STREET" with:HALLandSIDEWALK.*  Some people combine the signs "WATER" and STREET to mean "RIVER" [as in "WATER-WAY"] 
using a bit of a winding path] 
but I don't do that version personally.*  See:RIVER*
