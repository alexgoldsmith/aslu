The right sign for "accident" depends 
on your meaning.If you are talking about a mishap or a mistake, then you might want to use a 
variation of the sign for "MISTAKE."If you are talking about two people bumping into each other then you might want 
to use a variation of the sign for "MEET."If you are talking about two cars crashing into each other you might want to use 
classifiers to demonstrate what happened.Accident as in "two cars crashed" is done by using the "CRASH" sign.CRASH:This sign is "loosely" based on "CL:3" type handshapes.  But if you observe 
the sign done at high speed during signed conversations you'll notice that the 
handshape starts as a "modified 5" handshape that turns into an "S" shape.  
But again, it is easy to see the CL:3 roots of this sign.CRASH:Accident as in "I made a mistake" or "Whoops!"MISTAKE (error / wrong / "plans didn't work out")
