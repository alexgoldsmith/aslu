American Sign Language:  "bum"BUM:In an email message a student writes:Dr. Bill,I wouldn’t ask if I could find the answer elsewhere. The problem is that one of 
my go to online dictionaries doesn’t  show bum or sloppy, and both another 
online dictionary and my hard-bound dictionary indicate that the signs FARM, 
BUM, and SLOPPY are all done the same way.-- Name on fileDear Student,Well, I can't say as how they do those signs in Michigan, but to me they are all 
three very different signs.See my FARM and SLOPPY pages.The sign for the concept "bum" is open to a lot of debate.The most simple and straightforward way to sign "bum" in ASL is to do the sign 
LAZY with a single, large, movement ending with a solid thud on the upper, side 
chest, with a slightly exaggerated hold.You would think that a 3-letter word such as "bum" would tend to develop a 
fingerspelled version, but I don't really see that happening. The letters B-U-M 
don't seem to flow off the hand very well, and lexicalization of the B and the M 
ends with a muppet-like result.Personally, I use a variant of the sign "MENSTRUAL-PERIOD" to mean "bum." I 
picked up that sign in Salem Oregon about 20 years ago but I've seen it pop up 
in conversations in at least two other states so I know I didn't just make it 
up.-- Bill*
