The sign for share holds the non-dominant hand steady and brushes 
			pinkie side of the dominant hand along the side of the index finger 
			of the non-dominant hand moving toward the thumb and then reverses 
			the movement and moves back toward the fingertips again.Notes:If you were interpreting the term "shares" as in stock, I recommend 
			you spell "S-H-A-R-E-S."You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
