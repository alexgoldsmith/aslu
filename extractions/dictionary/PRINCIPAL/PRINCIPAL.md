This sign is good to use if you mean principal as in the leader 
			of a school or "the school principal."Touch the tip of the middle finger of the "P-hand" to the back of a  
  palm-down S-hand twice.This sign refers to the person "principal" of a school.  The sign "principle" 
  spelled with an "le" instead of "al" uses a different sign.PRINCIPAL:There is quite a bit of variation in ASL. Don't get hung up on the 
			small details.  My friend, Sean Benson signs "principal" by 
			starting with the dominant hand along side the non-dominant fist.  
			He then does a bit of a circular movement wherein he swings the "P" 
			hand up into position above the non dominant hand and then brings it 
			down once firmly.PRINCIPAL (another example)Note:I have another friend (Deaf) who the sign PRINCIPAL with the 
			non-dominant hand in a palm handshape facing down (instead of in a 
			fist shape).If you mean some other type of "principal" (other than the leader 
			of a school) you should use a different sign than the "P" on the 
			back of the fist.  For example:See:MAINSee:TOPSee:FIRSTIf you mean "principle" (note the different spelling) as in a 
			"guiding rule" then see:PRINCIPLEYou can learn
