The sign for "give" depends on your meaning.GIVE is a "directional verb."  Directional verbs are signs that  
    incorporate information about the subject and object (the doer and receiver 
    of the action).  That means you don't have to use a separate sign for 
    the subject and/or object when you use a directional verb.  This is 
    known as "agreement."  Or "subject-object agreement."me-GIVE-you (version 1) "hand to"me-GIVE-you (two handed version)GIVE-you (version 2)This version of the sign give uses an "x" handshape.GIVE-you (two handed "x" handshape version)you-GIVE-me:me-GIVE-him:If I wanted to indicate "HE GAVE IT TO ME," all I'd need to
