The sign for "other" is very similar to the sign for "TEN."I tend to use a double motion for the sign "TEN" and a single motion
for "OTHER."  But I do on occasion sign "TEN" using
just a quick, single motion. It depends on if you are feeling "more definite" you'd use the single motion.  
You can also use this sign to mean "else."OTHER / else:Sample sentence:
"Who else in your family knows sign language?" = "YOUR FAMILY, WHO 
ELSE SIGN?"Also see:ANYNotes:I recall observing a friend, (whom I consider a master communicator) 
teach a class of Deaf students.  I watched this teacher inflect the sign
"OTHER" with a very quick, small, double motion and a wh-q (furrowed
eyebrows, slightly tilted head) facial expression.  He was doing
it as his response to an incorrect answer from a student.  He had
asked a question, (the student responded), then instead of saying
"wrong" this skilled communicator signed "OTHER" using the
repeated motion and holding the sign in place for an extended time.  I
thought to myself, "WOW! What a great way of getting your student to try
a different answer without having to label him or her as being
wrong."  Using justonesign what he communicated was, "That is not the answer I'm
looking for, can you tell me someotherpossible solution to my
question?"Bravo!You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
