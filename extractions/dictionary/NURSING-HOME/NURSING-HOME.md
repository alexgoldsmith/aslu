The concept of "Nursing Home" can be expressed in a couple of 
			different ways.Some Deaf people are more "bilingual" than others and have adopted 
			the English word "nurse" and compounded it with "home" to mean 
			"nursing home."Some "ASL" instructors will tell you to spell "nursing" then 
			sign "HOME."   I suppose that is a "safe" answer.If the person with whom you are signing doesn't 
			understand what it means, sure, you canexplainthat it 
			means:  "HOME FOR 
			OLD PEOPLE."  Remember though, that is an explanation not a 
			"suggested sign."I'm going to go ahead and suggest that you signNURSE-HOMEbut I'll caution you that not everyone will agree with that sign.Another option (see below) is to sign SENIOR-CITIZEN-HOME -- which I 
			think is a decent choice.Also TAKE-CARE-HOME (compound sign with reduced movements) seems to 
			work very well (see below).- Dr. BillIn a message dated 1/28/2014 9:00:18 A.M. Pacific Standard Time,

					home.  In this area and in Seattle I occasionally see:  
					senior-citizens, home (senior citizens as sign with an S at 
					dominant corner of the mouth and then moving hand to the 
					non-dominant corner of the mouth and signing C).A certified interpreter in Seattle told me that she was 
					taught that 'senior-citizens home' is less harsh (her words) 
					and more respectful than 'old persons' home.'  In her words, 
					"Just like when we speak by voice, referring to someone as a 
					'senior citizen' is more respectful than calling them an

					home' as well - or not?  Your thoughts?- Lyn--------------------Dear Lyn,I think that "SENIOR-CITIZENS HOME" version is really neat.I also sort of like the idea of a "TAKE-CARE HOME" -- using the sign 
			that looks like KEEP.  Typically I do the sign TAKE-CARE-of 
			using a double movement but I find myself tending to using a single 
			contact of the K-hands followed by a single contact of the HOME 
			sign. (Thus it is expressed as a compound.)-- Bill--------------------In a message dated 1/18/2017 3:04:21 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, Lyn
