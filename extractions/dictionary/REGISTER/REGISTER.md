REGISTER or registration:  This version uses an "R" handshape.
Use a double motion.  Lay the right "R" hand across the
palm-side of the fingers of the left flat-hand. Then lift and move the
"R" two inches toward the heel of the left hand and lay the
"R" on the palm of the left hand.This version uses a "U" handshape.The sign for "signature" is often used to mean "register."SIGNATURE / CONTRACT / SIGN-UPSample sentence:Ha! In this next video I'm "attempting" to sign "Have you registered 
for school next year?" by using the signs, "next-YEAR SCHOOL FINISH 
REGISTER YOU?"But if you watch close you'll notice that at the beginning of the 
sign register I start to use the "U"-hand version and then I change 
my mind and switch over to the "R" hand version.  I'll have to 
redo that video, but I'll post it for now because it gives a great 
example of "next-YEAR."Also see:SIGNATURE
