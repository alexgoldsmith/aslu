The sign for "college" means both "college" as well as 
	"university." However If you initialize this sign with a "U" handshape on the
dominant hand, it means specifically "university."Both hands are in loose "flat" handshapes.  They are not "5" 
	handshapes, but then again they are not "B" handshapes either.  The 
	dominant hand starts from a couple inches above the base hand and does a 
	circling movement as it slaps downward and comes back up a few inches.Sample sentence: Did your dad go to college?COLLEGE:
