The sign for "Frisbee" is ... well actually there is no 
			sign for Frisbee.At least you aren't likely to find such a sign in an ASL dictionary 
			(other than this one).I'm including the concept here though because I want you to learn 
			how to "deal with uncertainty."  Just because you don't know 
			how to sign something doesn't mean you can't still have a signed 
			conversation about it.If you ask your Deaf buddy how to sign Frisbee he will likely tell 
			you one of three things:1.  Spell it.2.  Do a little movement that looks like you are throwing a 
			Frisbee. Repeat.3.  Hold up curved-"L"-hands and show the size and shape of a 
			Frisbee. (Which just happens to work well for the sign for "DISH." 
			(Or any round flat object.)Any of those approaches are fine. Number 3 -- holding up 
			curved-"L"-hands -- isn't enough by itself but can be combined with 
			the throwing movement and will thus be interpreted as aFrisbee. 
			(Unless your wife is having one ofthosedays and is throwing 
			dishes - in which case the facial expression of the sign would bemuchmore intense.)Frisbee:The double movement of the mime-like action helps to establish that you are 
	signing a noun ("Frisbee" or "game of Frisbee") rather than a verb.  If 
	you wanted to sign the verb phrase "throw the Frisbee" (assuming that you've 
	already established that you are talking about a Frisbee) you would simply 
	mime the movement of throwing a Frisbee using a single, large movement.You can learn
