	been an "initialized" version of the sign for FINISH but has mutated to the 
	point where it now has a movement somewhat similar to that of a baseball 
	umpire signaling "Safe!"Another version of "ready" uses a movement similar to one of the versions of 
	the sign "PLAN / prepare."  The "R" hands are both held in front of the 
	torso, off to one side a bit and then both are moved to the other side of 
	the torso using a somewhat quick, definite movement.READY (conveying the meaning of "We are prepared.")"Is everybody ready?!"If you are with a group preparing to "head out" to go somewhere and you want
