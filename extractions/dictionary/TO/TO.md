			Dr. Bill,Just wondering about the sign for "need to." I see the sign for 
			must/have-to, ought-to/should, and need....but what about 
			specifically "need to."For example, "i need to do my homework" and "i need money" use 
			"need" in slightly different ways. I supposed the homework sentence 
			is thesame as saying "i must do my homework"....either way, I have Deaf 
			friends that all sign "need to" by using the sign for "need" and 
			thenfingerspelling "to." They themselves are not sure if they are using 
			ESL or ASL when doing this.Thanks!!- Paul>>Dear Paul,In ASL the sign "NEED" automatically includes the concept of "to." 
			Thus you and your friends do not need to fingerspell nor sign "to" 
			when signing the concept of "need to."- Dr. BillNotes:*
