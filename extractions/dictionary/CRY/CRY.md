The sign for "cry" is
made by placing one or both index fingers under your eyes.Bring your fingers down over your cheeks a few times.CRY:CRY (version):Student:  I've seen this with an alternating
movement.Dr Bill:  Yes.  You'll see lots of variations on this one. 
For example, using a "4-handshape" on each hand instead of just the "index fingers" 
is a way of indicating that you
are cryinga lot. 
Or start with "S" handshapes and then suddenly move them downward and change 
them into "4-handshapes" with the fingers wiggling as you move the hands 
downward to indicate you are having a "major bawl."
