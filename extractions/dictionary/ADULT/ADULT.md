ADULT / tall:Let's compare "grow up" with a variation of that sign that we will call: ADULT.This version of ADULT can also mean "tall." (Or more specifically, one of the 
versions for the sign for "tall.")Hold a bent hand near the side of your head and then move it up (and a bit 
forward) quickly.ADULT / TALL-[bent-hand-version]For another version of "tall" see:TALLADULT-[initialized-version]-[not-recommended]This is an initialized version of "parent" based on mother/father, boy/girl 
locations.  It uses the letter "A" to represent the idea of "adult."  
Many d/Deaf people use this version, but your local teacher might consider it to 
be "signed English" so use this version with caution.Note:  If you replace the "A" with a "T" it can 
	mean
  "teenager." 
  Some people feel that using the "T" means the sign is "Signed English" and 
	that you should instead sign teenager by signing "young."RAISED / grow up:Show the person getting taller. Use a smooth relatively quick movement.
