	aid:Think of the initial for "Aunt"
      or "Uncle" next to the female or male-related sign position. 
      Notice how most male signs (boy, man, uncle, father, brother...) are done near
      the forehead or "brain" area--which is to say, where thethinkingoccurs, but most female-related signs (mother, sister, aunt) are
      near the mouth where thetalkingoccurs? I pointed this out to my wife and
      she explained it to me:  "Menthinkthey know what they
      aretalkingabout, women really do."
