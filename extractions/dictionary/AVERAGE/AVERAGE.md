The sign for average is done with the dominant hand in a 
			"flat-hand" shape and the non-dominant hand in an "open-B-hand" 
			shape.  The dominant hand taps the non-dominant hand twice at 
			the midpoint between the non-dominant hand's thumb and fingertips. 
			(The non-dominant hand doesn't move in this sign.)AVERAGE:Also see:ABOUTAlso see:APPROXIMATELYYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
