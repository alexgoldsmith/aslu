American Sign Language:  "balloon"The sign for 
"balloon" is done in ASL by miming the action of blowing up a balloon.BALLOON:Discussion:The "noun" form of the sign BALLOON is done smaller and quicker than the verb 
form. The verb form is done larger and (a bit) slower -- as if you were actually 
blowing up a balloon. The sentence will also provide context. If you use a sign 
like HAVE or MY prior to the sign for BALLOON it will be fairly obvious that you 
are talking about the thing and not the process of blowing up a balloon.*
