American Sign Language: "thorn"There is no one particular sign for thorn.  If it is important 
			for that specific word to be expressed you can fingerspell it.Often the context in which the signing occurs makes it obvious that 
			you are talking about thorns or a thorn and so you wouldn't need to 
			spell it out but rather you would just show what the thorn looks 
			like.For example, suppose you wanted to describe flower with lots of 
			thorns along the stem you could use your base hand in a "1" 
			handshape to represent the stem and slide a dominant "4" hand up the 
			stem while using a mean facial expression:Note: For the version above, you could either "slide" the four up 
			the 1, or you could place it on the 1 a couple times at higher 
			intervals.Another way to show a thorn would be to use the dominant "1" hand to 
			show how the thorn extends up and away from the main stem. The 
			dominant "1" finger "grows" out of the stem tracing the shape of a 
			thorn.Or you could use an "x" handshape (hooked finger) to represent the 
			shape of the thorns:Occasionally people ask 
			me how they would show a "crown of thorns" (as in theology).For that you again use strong facial expression and use your hands 
			to show the general shape and nature of the crown of thorns:*
