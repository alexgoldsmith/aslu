assignmentASSIGNMENT (version 1: uses the sign "appointment")This sign circles (horizontally, counterclockwise) the right "A"
  hand above the stationary left "A" hand then brings the right hand down on top
  of the left "A" hand.ASSIGNMENT (version 2)I don't know why, but I've seen quite a few people use the sign "NEGATIVE" to 
mean "assignment."
