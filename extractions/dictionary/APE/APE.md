As with many "very short" English words the concept of "ape" is 
			typically just fingerspelled.If you are telling a story (particularly to children) you very well 
			may choose to thump on your chest a couple of times as if you were 
			an ape.The sign for "gorilla" tends to just use the chest thumping 
			movement.If you need to distinguish between an "ape" and a "gorilla" you have 
			a couple of options:1.  Fingerspell A-P-E and sign "gorilla" by thumping your 
			chest.2.  Thump your chest a couple times with "A" hands (palm-side 
			facing toward your chest) to mean "ape."  Thump your chest a 
			couple of times with "S" hands to mean "gorilla."GORILLA or APE:Note: On first usage, if it is important to be specific about 
			whether your are signing "ape" or "gorilla" it is a good practice to 
			"fingerspell" either concept at least once for clarification.Also see:MONKEYAlso see:GORILLAYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
