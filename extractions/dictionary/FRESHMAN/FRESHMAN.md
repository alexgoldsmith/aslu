			doesn't brush "forward" off the nose, it brushes sideways across the 
			nose twice. I do not like that sign being used for Freshman but 
			indeed it is a variation that shows up in Texas (and elsewhere). You 
			will also see in Texas the more widespread (nation-wide) version 
			that taps the tip of the non-dominant ringer finger twice with the 
			dominant palm.One of the reasons I don't like using the "R"-hand brushing the nose 
			is because it conflicts with an initialized version of the sign for 
			RAT and/or MOUSE which is done with the same movement using the 
			index finger. If I have to use the both "rat" and "mouse" in the 
			same sentence I will sign RAT using the index finger and MOUSE using 
			the pinkie. Many ASL teachers will encourage you away from using 
			initialized versions of signs but the fact is such signs are "out 
			there" so what I try to do is show both signs and then indicate that 
			my preferred sign is generally the non-initialized version as long 
			as the meaning is made clear via context. For what it is worth, I 
			also recall seeing the sign for FOX being used to mean "freshman." 
			(Again, I would encourage you to stick with the standard nation-wide 
			general version of "freshman" that taps the ring finger of the 
			non-dominant hand with the dominant palm).Cordially,Dr. BillIn a message dated
