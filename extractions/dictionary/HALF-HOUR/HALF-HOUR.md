show this. Is this not done in your deaf community?Thanks for the help!- AmyDear Amy,I generally will use the "1/2" sign as part of sign "an hour and a half." But 
for the sign "half-hour" done by itself in isolation I'd recommend the version 
that does a 180 degree spin on the palm starting pointing up and finishing 
pointing down.- Dr. Billp.s. By all means though -- do it the way it is commonly done in your local Deaf 
community. No sense being a martyr.
