A student writes:Dr. Bill,I am looking for a sign for the word "cave" as in "Mammoth Cave" or 
			"Carlsbad Caverns." I'm sure there is one. It just seems to be one 
			of those secret handshake things.Thank you.- MaxHi Max,I tend to just spell "C-A-V-E" but if I'm telling a story of some sort 
			I whip out a couple of "C" handshapes and show (depict) 
			what the cave looks like (long, twisted, narrow, etc.) while using 
			my face to indicate if it is spooky or not.- Dr. BillCAVE (Version 1)Note: When spelling C-A-V-E the "E" tends to mutate into a 
			two-fingered version of "E"due to 
			coming after the letter "V."CAVE:Note: For the sign "CAVE" you only move the dominant hand -- unless you are describing a 
			very long tunnel or pipeline that extends quite a distance both ways. 
			In that case you'd have the right hand go off to the right and the 
			left hand go off to the left.Also see:PIPELINEAlso see:TUNNELAlso see:POLEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
