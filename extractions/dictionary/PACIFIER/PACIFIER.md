American Sign Language: "pacifier"There is no one "perfect" sign for "pacifier."  In general you are going to 
have to mime the action of putting one into your mouth using either an "x" 
handshape or a loose "G" handshape.  Or you can tap your lips 
			twice with the front knuckle of the X-hand.PACIFIER (version 1)Use an "x" hand or a modified X hand:There is another version that uses a loose "G" handshape.Notes:I have seen people using a palm-back-"T" hand for the sign for 
			pacifier.  If you seenativeDeaf adults in your local 
			area doing the sign, feel free to copy them.  While 
			I sort of like the iconic (picture-like) aspects of that version I'm 
			not totally comfortable with it.*
