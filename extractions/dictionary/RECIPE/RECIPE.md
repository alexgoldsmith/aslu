			Youtube videos show people fingerspelling it.Thank you for your time,Elyn TibbsASL I StudentElyn,Hello :)In general the concept of "recipe" is indeed fingerspelled.  I 
			encourage you to practice spelling "recipe" over and over again 
			until you can spell it fast enough that you are no longer concerned 
			about finding a "sign" for it and are instead perfectly comfortable 
			spelling it just as you see Deaf people do.I will however mention a couple of signs related to the concept of 
			"recipe" that you may find helpful.CARD-(square or rectangle)Draw a rectangle in the air with your index fingers and thumbs.INSTRUCTIONS/ describe / 
			explainHold "F" hands out in front of you and slide one forward while you 
			slide the other backward. Then alternate the movement.*
