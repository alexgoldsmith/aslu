American Sign Language: "ink"There is an old sign that I swear I saw in a book in my youth. Maybe it was in 
Martin Sternberg's old ASL dictionaryclassic-- will have to check. 
Anyway the sign is:INK: Dominant hand: upside-down-"i"-handshape-(as if representing a pen or 
quill), Non-dominant hand: sideways-(pinkie-edge-down)-"O"handshape-(as if 
representing a small bottle). Movement: Dip the pen into the ink twice.Of course, these days most experts would say to simply "spell it.Notes:*
