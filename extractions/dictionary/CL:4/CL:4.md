DISCUSSION:An interpreter from Michigan (Volleyjen0416) writes:I have a question for you.When you use the CL:4 Classifier for "line of people" where is the 
          front of the line? my index finger on my right hand or my pinky on my 
          left hand?Thanks,JenniferJennifer,It depends on how you set it up.If you hold up your left 4 hand and then move your right 4 hand 
          backward (toward your right shoulder) that means the front of the line 
          is your left pinkie.If you hold up your left 4 hand then put the right 4 hand on the 
          outside (away from you) and move the right 4 hand further away from 
          you then the left index finger is the head of the line.:)- BillWilliam G. Vicars, Ed.D.Asst. Professor of ASL and Deaf StudiesCalifornia State University - Sacramento
