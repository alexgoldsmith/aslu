the left hand is forward.CHANGE (coins)Place an "F" hand on your palm, then make a little arc up, forward, and down

	your mind" or "I changed my mind."I'm scared that signing it literally 
	would be signed English, but if there was a way of saying it in ASL I would 
	love to see it!Thanks for your help!-LiannLiann,The phrase, "I changed my mind," would indeed be done by using the standard 
	sign for CHANGE.Unless there was a specific need to state "my" mind, you can just drop the 
	sign "MY" and it would be understood that it is "my" mind that is being 
	changed because I just recently pointed at myself.To sign "change your mind" it would be good to insert the sign YOUR. If you 
	are signing, Did you change your mind? you could just sign, "YOU CHANGE 
	MIND?" with your eyebrows raised.Cordially,-- Dr. BillAlso see:TRANSLATEAlso see:EXCHANGEWant to help support
