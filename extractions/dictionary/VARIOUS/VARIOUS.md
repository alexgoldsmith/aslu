The sign for "VARIOUS" flutters the index finger up and down as you 
			move the hands out to the side.Note: "various" is a different sign from "varying." "Varying" is a 
			larger movement and uses a a lot more wrist and elbow movement. I 
			need to post a video for "varying." (under construction)Also seeETCETERAYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
