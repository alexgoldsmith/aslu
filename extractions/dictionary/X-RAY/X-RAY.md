The concept of "x-ray" is generally just fingerspelled.But you may see some people do a version of the sign that uses an 
			"X" hand and then shows a ray of light.X-RAY (version 2)Show the fingerspelled letter "X" then hold up a "crushed-O" hand 
			(aimed downward and to the center) and move the hand downward and to 
			the center as you open it up into a palm-down "5-hand."  What 
			you are doing is using a version of the sign for "beam or ray of 
			light" to represent the "ray" portion of the sign.Like I said, most of the time we just spell "x-ray."  The "X" + 
			"ray of light" version could be useful for certain situations in 
			which you might want to show exactly what is being x-rayed by aiming 
			your beam of light at a particular body part or area of the body.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
