American Sign Language: 
		"where"The sign for "where"
is made using an INDEX-finger handshape. Hold your hand in front of you and
  "pivot" the hand side to side a couple of times. The movement 
is in the wrist and elbow NOT in the finger joint.WHERE?:Memory aid:In the days before GPS and electronic maps on phones people used to use 
paper-based maps.A very common way of using such a map would be to put your finger on the map and 
move your fingertip a bit to this side or that side as attempted to figure out "where" 
you were on the map.WHERE?Notice the "furrowed eyebrows?"  They are part of the
sign.  When asking questions you use "furrowed eyebrows" for all of the "wh-"
question types:  WHO, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, WHICH, FOR-FOR=(what-for).  
	However, if you are asking a yes/no question (a question that can be 
	answered with a yes or no) your eyebrows should be up.Remember:Eyebrows up for "yes/no" questions.Eyebrows down for "wh" questions.(Unless it is a rhetorical question. But that is another lesson for a later 
	time).Also, consider the difference between a “D” handshape and a “1" or 
	"index-finger” handshape. You should do signs like “WHERE” and "MEET" 
	using the 1/index-finger handshape (not a “D” handshape).*
