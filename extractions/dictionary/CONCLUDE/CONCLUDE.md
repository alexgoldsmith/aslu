Bill,The sign for "conclude" is the same as "end" right? Is conclusion the 
		same? AsÂ I read things, I tend to 'interpret' them in my head. I came 
		across a reading with "conclusion" and "summarize" in the same sentence. 
		How would you correctly sign that?No rush, just wondering.Thanks! Cynthia
