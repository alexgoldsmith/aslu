The sign forclothesuses a double movement.You move the "five" hands downward along your
  body.  The sign starts with the tips of your thumbs about an inch out
  from your chest.  As you move the sign downward, you typically touch your thumbtips
  to your chest where they drag for an inch or two before losing contact as you
  continue to move your hands on down.Note: You don't "have to" actually make contact.You do the motion twice.  The
  movement is quick. Sort of as if you had a piece of lint on your shirt and
  were brushing it off with the tip of your thumb.CLOTHES:Note:  If you do this sign with a single large exaggerated downward
  movement, it means "DRESS" or "GOWN."DRESS: The sign for "a dress" uses the "5 handshape on each hand." The sign 
	starts at the upper chest (either very close to the body or actually 
	touching the upper chest area with your thumbs). Use a downward brushing 
	movement as if showing the way a dress hangs on your body.Note:  If you do the sign for "DRESS" (single movement)
  starting from your waist or hips it would mean SKIRT.  The sign for SKIRT
  uses contact with the heels of your hands rather than the thumbtips.SKIRT:  Hold your hands in a "5-handshape" near your waist and move 
  them downward and outward a bit.
  Use a single movement.See:SKIRT
