American Sign Language: "avocado"Lately the sign I've seen going around in 2018 for AVOCADO is to mime the 
	twisting of the avocado halves.   (You know how your slice an 
	avocado then twist it to separate the two halves. Just pretend you are 
	holding an avocado and twist it.)In a message dated 4/26/2005 8:25:29 AM Pacific Daylight Time,

		M.,Hello :)As you've noticed (in your unfruitful search for it on the net), the 
		sign for "AVOCADO" is a not that widely known.Since I moved to California (United States) I've seen quite a few of my 
		friends using a sign for AVOCADO that looks like you are slicing the pit 
		from an avocado.You cup your left hand (if you are right handed) as 
		if holding an avocado) and then you form your right hand into an "A" 
		handshape. Then you pretend your thumb (on the "A" hand) is a knife and 
		you slice the "pit" from the "avocado."Cordially,BillVariation:At least one version of the sign for avocado in South America uses an "S" hand and a "Curved Hand."  You use a 
		mashing motion as you bring the "S" hand forward into the "curved" hand 
		with a twist.  Repeat.AVOCADO (South American variation: shown to 
		me by a Deaf man from South America).
