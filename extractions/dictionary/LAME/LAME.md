American Sign Language: "lame"Discussion:This sign shows the 
	movement of a lame person's legs.Notes:A colleague writes:Hi Bill,Re:  The sign you show for 'lame' in your Lifeprint Dictionary.That is a familiar sign, one I've used for years.My question is this:  If we are referring to a 'lame excuse' or want to say that 
someone gave a 'lame' speech, what sign would we use? Would we use the sign for 
'weak; feeble?'  Or not?Thank you.[Name on File]Dear [name]A couple of thoughts on this.First thought is that some people consider the use of the word "lame" should not 
be applied to contexts other than a person or animal that is actually "lame" in 
the physical sense.Such people are offended by and/or disapprove of the use of the word "lame" as a 
derogatory term.As far as ASL signs I suggest: LOUSY, BAD, NG-[no-good], STUPID, or DUMB.  
You might also use something like, "YOUR EXCUSE? I NOT ACCEPT!" or "YOUR EXCUSE? 
I NOT SATISFY."- Dr. Bill*
