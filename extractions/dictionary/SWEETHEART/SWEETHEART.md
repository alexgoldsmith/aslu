The sign for sweetheart holds modified "A" hands near the chest 
			(over the heart works well).The sign starts with the thumbs extended and then you bring the 
			thumbs down, up, and down again.Notes:In a message dated 1/22/2013 5:29:39 A.M. Central Standard

						your help on. I keep seeing a sign used in ASL music 
						videos. It's the sign for "text", as in texting with a 
						phone, but people are using that sign to replace the 
						word "baby." Is this a real sign that can be used in a 
						more romantic phrasing of the word "baby," or is it just 
						slang? And would it be appropriate to use in 
						conversation when not referring to an actual baby?Thank you for your response!- EmilyDear Emily,That sign you are seeing isn't the sign for texting. It is the sign 
			for "sweetheart."People tend to substitute the sign "sweetheart" for the word "baby" 
			in signed songs.Cordially,Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
