The sign for "negative," or "minus" touches the side of your "index" 
	finger to the palm of your base hand.NEGATIVE or minus:Notes:For most simple negation you don't need any separate sign--you just shake 
  your head negatively while signing.For example, if I sign "I TEACHER"while shaking my head negatively, it means 
  "I'm not a teacher."There is also a general sign that means "not." To sign "not," form your 
	dominant hand into an "A" hand.  Touch the pad of the thumb under your 
  chin. 
  Quickly move the hand forward a few inches.NOT:There is a general sign for "don't."This signisn'tused for signs like "DON'T-LIKE" 
  and "DON'T-WANT."  Such signs use 
  "reversal of orientation for negation" instead.I rarely use this sign unless I'm attempting to strongly emphasize a point.DON'T:This is the general sign for "no."You can use either a single or a double motion.  (Meaning, you can close 
  the fingers and thumb either once or twice.)NO:"None of your business" = NYB  (Or even NYOB).I've always thought this was interesting...the sign for "It's none of your 
  business."  It comes from the first letters of the words "none of your 
  business." Often the order is changed around a bit to be NYOB.  The reason 
  is likely because it "rolls off the hand" much more smoothly than NOYB.  
  I haven't seen this sign for quite a while, (I guess I've been hanging out 
  with a more polite group?), but it is such an interesting sign that I couldn't 
  resist sharing it with you:  The movement is quick and ends with a type 
  of flourish (in which you change into the B using sort of "be gone 
  peasant" flick of the hand).NYBAlso See:don't-caredon't-minddon't wantdon't liketake-awayWAVE-NO
