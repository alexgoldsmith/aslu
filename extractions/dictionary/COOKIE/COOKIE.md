The right (or dominant) hand is in aloose"C" handshape. You bring the 
	right hand down onto the left hand, then you lift up the right hand rotate 
	it and bring it down again on the left hand. Twist your right hand as if 
	cutting out cookies from cookie dough."What kind of cookies do you like?" = COOKIE, YOU LIKE WHAT-KIND?Notes: A student asks:Student: "Does COOKIE use a rotating letter C in the palm of the the opposite 
	hand?"Dr Bill: Youcoulduse the letter "C" but I use a more relaxed "claw type" 
	hand. There is no need to initialize the sign COOKIE with the English letter 
	"C." The handshape is based on the general size and shape of a cookie -- not 
	on the English word. Yes, the loose-C rotates but it also moves up and off 
	the palm as it rotates and then comes back down onto the palm to finish the 
	sign.Note: ASL and English are two distinct (different) languages. You should 
	avoid trying to force ASL to become more English-like by adding unnecessary 
	"letters" to signs that are alreadyclear and well establishedin the 
	Deaf community.Â  Focus on learning to sign like native Deaf adults do.
