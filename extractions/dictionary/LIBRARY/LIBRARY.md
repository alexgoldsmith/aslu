LIBRARY:Circle an "L" in the air.Â  The circle moves clockwise fromyourperspective and counter clockwise from the other person's 
  perspective.LIBRARIAN:On one of her answers for the Unit 3 video, a student typed:"246. your family any library and agent"She missed the gist of this sentence.A proper interpretation of the video would be:"Is anyone in your family a librarian?"Thestudy sheetindicated:"YOUR FAMILY ANY LIBRARY+AGENT?"The signed concept of LIBRARY plus the concept of AGENT combine to mean 
  "librarian."It is as if the student was translating from the study sheet rather than from 
  the video which is why she might have interpreted the plus sign "+" as meaning 
  "and." The plus sign is included simply to indicate that two signed concepts 
  are joined.The sign "AND" was not signed on the video and is not part of that sentence.
