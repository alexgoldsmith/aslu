The word "play" has several different signs depending on what you mean.If you mean play as in an "act" or a "drama," see:See: 
	THEATER / act / play / dramaIf you mean "play" as in "playing around" then you can use the version 
	of this sign that shakes "Y" handshapes.PLAY (as in "play time," "playing,")Sample sentence: BASKETBALL, YOU LIKE PLAY? (Do you like to play 
	basketball?)PLAYER:  To sign "player" simply add the "PERSON /AGENT" 
	sign to the sign PLAY.PARTY:  The sign PLAY happens to be one of the versions of the sign 
	for "party."  There are four common ways to sign "party."  The 
	point I want to make here though is that you should NOT initialize the sign 
	play with a "P" hand.See:PARTYNotes:I've observed quite a few educators of Deaf children using an initialized form 
	of PLAY (with a "T" handshape) for the
  sign "TOYS."  Which is to say, some of them do the sign for 
	"toys" by signing "play" using
  "T" handshapes.   I don't really think that is such a good 
	idea.  To me it looks sort of like "double bathroom" or something.In context, the "Y" handshape version of the sign PLAY can be used to mean 
	"toys" but I and most of my associates just spell "T-O-Y-S."
