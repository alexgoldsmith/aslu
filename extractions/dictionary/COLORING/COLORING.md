	a side to side movement as if filling in a coloring in a book. I would NOT 
	use a "4" handshape to the palm of the base hand for the exact reason you 
	mention--it would be confused with "study."--BillIn a message dated 5/20/2007 2:21:15 P.M. Pacific Daylight Time, melcwwm@

			attention that the word "crayon" is signed the same way.  Is there a

			two words?Thanks, in advance, for your time:MaryEllenMaryEllen,One approach to this would be to sign "coloring" as COLOR-WRITE.And then sign "Crayon" as a combination of "COLOR" and a modified version of 
	the sign ART.This modified version of the sign "ART" uses the same "I" handshape as "ART" 
	but the palm orientation is dominant hand palm-down instead of palm-back.  
	The pad of the pinkie finger's fingerprint area is touched to the palm of 
	the base hand and is "rubbed" side to side as if the pinkie itself were a 
	crayon being used to color on a piece of paper.Please do let me know if you come across any other variations.I have seen people initialize the sign WRITE using a "C" handshape to mean 
	"Crayon" but I would not recommend using that variation.My wife signs "coloring" without using the base hand. She just signs COLOR 
	and then does a writing movement in the air. (I don't recommend that either, 
	but hey don't tell her I said anything).  If I sign COLOR and then do 
	the movement in the air I'd interpret that as meaning, "color on a wall, or 
	on the (white) board."Cordially,Dr. Bill
