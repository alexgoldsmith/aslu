CRASH:Sample sentence: CAR CL:3/CL:3-"crash" HOW-MANY TIME YOU? (How many times have 
you been in a car wreck?)CRASH:This sign is "very loosely" based on "CL:3" type 
handshapes.Â  But if you observe the sign done at high speed during signed 
conversations you'll notice that the handshape starts more as a "modified 5" 
handshape that turns into an "S" shape.
