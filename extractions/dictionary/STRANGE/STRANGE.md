STRANGE / odd / unusual / bizarre:Sample sentence:
			"Do you like try strange new food?" = FOOD, STRANGE NEW, YOU LIKE 
			EAT?Notes:STRANGER:  The English concept of "stranger" (as in an unknown 
			person) doesn't have a directly equivalent sign in ASL.Some people sign "STRANGE +PERSON/AGENT" to mean
  			"stranger."I don't really recommend that approach, but if you do decide to use 
			the signs STRANGE and PERSON to mean to mean "someone you
  don't know" then you'll want to do a more mild facial
  expression. If you are referring to some new weirdo stalking you, then by all means, go ahead and use
  the "strange" sign and facial expression.However, I think it would be good to understand that most of the 
			time the concept of "stranger" would be conveyed through a different 
			set of signs. For example:Example: "DAD, SOMEONE THERE DOOR, don't-KNOW WHO, NEVER SEE BEFORE.Another way to express the concept of "stranger" (as in someone that 
			you don't know) is by signing "NEW+AGENT."Also see:WEIRDAlso see:ODDYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
