		allergy, skin allergy?Marci,For "allergy" you use the sign "opposite.""Hay fever" is often just spelled out: H-A-Y F-E-V-E-R. (The second 
			"E" in "fever" will certainly mutate into a two fingered version).  
			Or spell out H-A-Y and then sign OPPOSITE. Or if the other person 
			doesn't already know what "hay fever" means then you could sign:  GROW GROW NOSE-OPPOSITE (include facial expression).For "food allergy" you generally sign:  "I CAN'T EAT (name of food), OPPOSITE ME."For "skin allergy" you grab a pinch of skin on the back of your non-dominant hand then sign "OPPOSITE."  Or you sign 
			"(name of substance) I ITCH!"  For example, "PERFUME? I ITCH!"  (Which 
			basically means "perfume makes me itch"). Or you can show the specific skin reaction:  RED 
			"bumps", or SWELLING, or RED-"surface area"- Dr. BillYou can learn AmericanSign
