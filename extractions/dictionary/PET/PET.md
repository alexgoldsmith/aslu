The sign for "pet" looks like you are petting an animal. 
  If you do this sign using two quick, small, motions it means "a
  pet."  If you use a larger double motion it means "to pet" 
	or "petting." 
  If you use a sarcastic facial expression and exaggerate the contact between
  your hands it can be used to mean "spoiled" -- as in "he is the
  teacher's pet."Sample sentence: "Do you have a pet?"PET:
