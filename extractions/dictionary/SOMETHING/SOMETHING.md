The sign we label as "SOMETHING"  is also commonly labeled as "SOMEONE" 
	or "SINGLE."  The "single/something/someone" sign has many 
	meanings (such as "alone" or "only") that depend on the rest of your 
	sentence.To do this sign, point your index finger up, have the palm pointing up and 
	somewhat back towards you. Move your hand in a small horizontal circle--as 
	if tracing a circle the size of a quarter on the underside of a table.SINGLE / SOMEONE / SOMETHING:Sample sentence: "Are you going steady with someone?"Also see:SINGLE
