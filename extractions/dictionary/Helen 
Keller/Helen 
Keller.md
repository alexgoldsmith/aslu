Dear Bill,I am tutoring a hearing student in sign language who is doing a report onHelen Keller. The student would like to know if Helen Keller had 
	a name sign. I've always fingerspelled her name but I told the student I 
	would ask around. Do you know of a name sign for her?Thank you,- Cindy-----DearCindy,Helen Keller's name sign is done by signing the letter H then K near the 
	side of the eye.Â  (Or at least that is the concept. The "H" ends up 
	more like a "U" due to the stress on the wrist of signing an "H" in that 
	location.)The world experts on Helen Keller's name-sign would be the folks at the 
	Helen Keller Center for the Deaf-Blind.You might want to check with them to see what version they use.If they differ, please do let me know.- BillAlso see: "Helen Keller"Also see: "Laura Bridgman"
