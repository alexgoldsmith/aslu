			you, palms down, about three inches distance between your thumbs 
			(which are pointing at each other. The index fingers are pointing 
			forward). Then, VERY quickly move both hands to the sides six inches 
			while changing them into "S" hands with a very firm, solid ending. 
			There is no wavy movement. No double movement. Just a quick changing 
			from L's into "S" hands.Cordially,Dr. BillLifeprint.comYou can learn AmericanSign
