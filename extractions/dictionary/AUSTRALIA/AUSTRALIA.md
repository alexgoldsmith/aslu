ASL: "Australia"A common version of the ASL sign for Australia:You may see a version showing the 8-handshape with the pads of 
the middle finger and thumb touching rather than the tip of the middle finger 
touching the pad of the thumb.  Both versions are legit.  There is a lot of 
variation though so see the notes below.The Auslan Sign Bank (at auslan.org.au/dictionary) also shows the "8-hand to 
5-hand" version of AUSTRALIA:(Source: Australia/Australian search result from "The Auslan Dictionary,"

and drop) version of the sign for Australia is purported to have originated 
based on the concept of British prisoners having been exiled to (picked up and 
dropped off in) Australia. (Lapiak, 2019)“New South Wales, a state in southeast Australia, was founded by the British as 
a penal colony in 1788. Over the next 80 years, more than 160,000 convicts were 
transported to Australia from England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, in lieu of 
being given the death penalty.” (Sood, 2012)Let's dig a bit deeper though.I encourage you to consider the difference between these two phrases or terms:1. “related to”versus:2. “originated from"In the minds of many signers the sign AUSTRALIA is indeed currently “related to” 
or "associated with" kangaroos. That is what they think of when they "relate to" 
the sign AUSTRALIA.   Let me state that again.  Many people 
really do make the association between kangaroos and AUSTRALIA.   If 
the sign for AUSTRALIA started out being associated with something else that 
doesn't mean that AUSTRALIA isn't currently influenced by the mental association 
many people have today.Once in a while two ideas get romantic, then pregnant, and something NEW is born. 
Here are the two ideas:1. British prisoners being picked up and dropped off.2. Kangaroos bouncing alongWhen we take the handshape of the "pick up and drop off version" of the old 
sideways moving sign for AUSTRALIA and combine it with the forward moving bounce 
of a kangaroo -- Shazam!!! -- A new 
baby idea (or association in the mind) is born – and that idea now has characteristics of BOTH its parents:Thehandshapeof the older, originating “moving prisoners” sign, AND…Themovementof the newer assumed reason (“hopping kangaroos”) sign.Thus the currently existing and widespread version of the sign AUSTRALIA has 
a different movement from the (purported) original sign and a different handshape from the kangaroo-based 
rationale for the sign ("8"-hands vs bent-hands).A defensible statement 
regarding the rationale and/or etymology for the (current as of 2019) sign for 
AUSTRALIA might be:The handshape, internal movement (8-handshape changing to an open-8) and arching 
movement of the sign
AUSTRALIA probably originated from the concept of British prisoners being exiled 
(picked up and dropped off) to Australia.  The direction of the sign 
(forward, rather than sideways) and ongoing apparent evolution in handshape (as 
documented in occurrences of handshape variations depicting paws as seen done by some 
Portuguese and Turkish signers) are indicative of an association with the sign for 
KANGAROO.Here is an example of the "pick up 
and drop off" version of AUSTRALIA as done by Karl O'Keeffe, webmaster of 
http://www.signmonkey.net/ --- an online video dictionary of British Sign 
Language.(Source: O'Keeffe, Karl, (n.d.) “Australia,” Signmoney.net, Retrieved 1/19/2019 
from:https://media.signbsl.com/videos/bsl/signmonkey/mp4/australia.mp4)Just because a sign has "one" origin story doesn't mean that the sign cannot 
continue evolving, change into a new sign, and be associated with a new or 
different "origin" or "reason for being signed that way." It is quite likely 
that people worldwide associate Australia (the place) more with kangaroos than 
prisoners. The question becomes:  Which do more people associate with 
Australia?: Prisoners or kangaroos?  Imagine this:Signer 1:  Hey, I have an idea!   Let's do a sideways pick up and 
set down movement and associate it with "prisoners."Signer 2:  Hey, I have a better idea!  Let's take that sign of yours 
and move it forward instead of sideways and associate it with "kangaroos!"Signer 1:  On no!  It was my idea first!  You can't modify or 
change my idea!Signer 2:  Opps, did it.Eventually even more than the movement direction of AUSTRALIA might evolve.  
For example, here is a version of AUSTRALIA as being done by a signer using 
Portuguese sign at 
the Spread The Sign online dictionary:Here is a version of AUSTRALIA as 
being done by a signer using Turkish sign at the Spread The Sign online 
dictionary:The above are examples of AUSTRALIA. They are listed under the "Australia" 
entry for their respective signed languages. These examples are included here to 
help demonstrate the fact that some signers or signed languages have evolved 
further away from an association with "pick up and drop off" and closer to an 
association with "paws and hop, hop."  The versions above also 
are representative of how many people sign "kangaroo."  Thus we see the 
sign KANGAROO being used by some people to mean "Australia."AUSTRALIA-[legacy-version]-[version 
of: ANTHROPOLOGY]-[version of: CUBA]References:Lapiak, J. (2019)  “This sign is often assumed to be related to a 
kangaroo's paws. But, the actual reason behind the sign is that England picked 
up and dropped British convicts off as an "exile" in Australia by ship (noted by 
Andrew Knox and Deaf Australians).”(Source: Lapiak, J. (2019) “ASL sign for: Australia,” Handspeak, retrieved
