"9" hanshape that I use. That is fine. They are both good.  Some people 
even do "CAT" with a "G" hand that closes. (Which I don't recommend, but it is 
still a 
legit version of "CAT.")KETCHUP:CAT-UP variation 2:You might also see the "up" concept signed by pointing upward or by moving an "A" handshape upward (the thumb pointing up).KETCHUP:Here is a general version that looks like trying to get ketchup out of a
