The sign for "blood" is a combination of the signs "red" and "trickle down."In this example, my left hand (my non-dominant hand)isn'ttouching 
			my body. (And is not supposed to either -- so that's good eh?.)  The handshape of the 
  			non-dominant hand can be a loose "B" or "4" hand.Just hold your non-dominant hand in front of your chest, while you 
			do an abbreviated version of RED with your dominant-hand index 
			finger and smoothly transition into a "trickle down" movement over 
			the non-dominant hand (fluttering the fingers of the dominant hand 
			just a bit as it goes down).BLOOD:If someone is getting their blood drawn, you can sign that by 
			starting with a bent-5 hand at the inside crook of the non-dominant 
			arm. Move the hand forward and down along the arm a bit as you 
			change the handshape into a flattened "O" shape.  (Note: A 
			bent-5-hand is like a claw-hand but the middle and small knuckles 
			are straight.  The fingers are bent at the large knuckle but 
			not the other two.)DRAW-OUT-BLOOD:To sign "blood pressure," use a right "C" hand. Pat the left bicep twice as 
	if showing the cuff used when taking someone's blood pressure.BLOOD-PRESSURE:Note: You may see some people combine the signs BLOOD and STRESS-(pressure) 
	to mean "blood pressure."You can learn AmericanSign
