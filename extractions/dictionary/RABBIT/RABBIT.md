The sign for "rabbit" shows two ears flopping.Use "U" handshapes and bend at the large knuckles twice.RABBIT:Hmmm...I'm going to redo that graphic someday and do the palm 
			orientation of each hand more towards the back (bunny ears flop 
			toward the back a bit, not straight out to the sides).There is another sign for "rabbit" that I think of as meaning 
			"bunny" (but both versions mean rabbit or bunny).Hold "B"-hands (flat hands actually) on the upper sides of your head (as 
	if they were bunny ears). The palms are facing backward. Fold your "ears" 
	back twice.BUNNY / RABBIT:Notes:If the palms were facing forward, this sign would mean) "donkey." If 
			facing forward and using a single movement it can mean "stubborn."See:DONKEYAlso see:FOXYou can learn AmericanSign
