American Sign Language: "count 
		on" / "rely on"A student writes:Hi Dr. Bill,I just wondered how to sign the idiom "count on" which means to rely or to 
depend on someone or something. In this case, do I use the sign for count (as in 
counting money) with your F-handshape sliding forward your base hand in a flat 
handshape? or should I use the sign for "depend on / rely" instead?- JoseJose,For sure you should useDEPENDto mean "count on."  
TheCOUNTsign doesn't mean or indicate "reliability" at 
all.- Dr. BillDEPEND-ON / rely on / count on:See:DEPENDNotes:Also see:COUNT*
