The right sign for "lose" or "lost" depends on your meaning. 
For example:
"Did you lose your keys?" uses a different sign for "lose" than the 
sentence, "Did you lose the game?"  See below for the different 
versions.LOSE or "lost" (misplaced)As in: "I lost my keys."Make the sign for "more" and then turn both hands palms down
while relaxing your fingers.  Pretend you were holding something between
your hands and it slipped.  This sign is used when you mean the opposite
of found.LOSE as in "fail a competition, or "We LOST at the track meet."LOSE or FAIL (animation)In a message dated 3/29/2005 7:08:56 AM Pacific Standard Time,

The movement is a straight line that moves down quickly without stopping 
and smacks into the other hand rather strongly.
Think of someone falling to the ground--splat.
