To do sign for "loud"points to (or touch) your ear and then shake your fists back and forth."Last night the thunder and lightening was very loud 
	and noisy!"Note: If you ask ten different people to sign this sentence for you you will 
	invariably getten different answers.  How do I know?  I've 
	asked many dozens of people to sign it.  For what it is worth, here is 
	my variation:Notes:  I sign "PAST / before" to mean "last" inthissentence.For THUNDER, I point to the ear then I use a firm converse double movement 
	with both hands using "handshape: 5."For LIGHTENING, I make a downward  zigzagging 
	movement with index fingers.For "very" I did the sign "OOH" which uses an intense facial expression and 
	the dominant hand in a claw shape making shaking movement in front of the 
	lower face.For LOUD, I point to the ear then I use a firm converse 
	double movement with two hands using "handshape: S" on each hand.For NOISY, I point to the ear then I use a simultaneous 
	twisting movement of both hands using "handshape: 5."If you wanted, you could have a lot of fun and/or get 
	into a lot of heated arguments over the "right way" to do the sentence:  
	"Last night the thunder and lightening was very loud and noisy!" 
	Realistically though, there is nooneright way -- just a lot of 
	varying ways. What I've shown you above are some "good ways" that should 
	fill your need until you find a "better way."Good luck  :)Also see:NOISE
