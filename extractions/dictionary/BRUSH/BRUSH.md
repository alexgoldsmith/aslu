American Sign Language:  "brush"Yes, yes, it has been a while since I've used 
one, but it is like riding a bike, once you've learned, you never forget how.The general sign for "brush" is to 
make a couple of brushing movements near your hair, (or in my case, where your 
hairusedto be).  If you were "brushing a horse" you would spell 
brush and then do couple of brushing movements in the air as if you were 
actually brushing a horse.  If you want to sign "brush 
your teeth" you would just make a couple of side to side movements with your 
index finger in front of your teeth.BRUSH:Also see:COMBAlso see:BRUSH-TEETH*
