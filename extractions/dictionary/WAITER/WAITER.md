American Sign Language: 
		"waiter," "waitress," "server"The sign for "waiter," "waitress," "server" uses the sign "SERVE" and then 
	adds the "PERSON" ending.To sign "serve," slide one hand forward, then move it back while sliding the 
	other hand forward.Memory tip:  Think of handing someone various plates of food.WAITER, "waitress," or "servant:"Sample sentence: "How much should I tip the server?" = 
	SERVER-[waiter/waitress] I SHOULD TIP how-MUCH-[1-handed-version]?Notes:In real life, if I'm sitting at a table with my friends and wanted to ask 
	that question, I'd just spell "T-I-P" and sign HOW-MUCH? I'd furrow my 
	eyebrows while signing HOW-MUCH since it is a "wh-type question."  It 
	would be obvious from the surroundings that I'm talking about the waiter or 
	waitress.  So just by signing "T-I-P HOW-MUCH?" my meaning would be 
	clear.  Also, remember to furrow your eyebrows when signing "HOW-MUCH" 
	in this question.Notes:There is another sign for waiter 
	that is quite popular in certain regions. Amongst Deaf adult native signers and socially active 
	advanced signers throughout much of California a somewhat common sign for 
	"waiter" is the "circling horns" version. (See below.)  At first glance 
	it might seem strange to some of you who have used the "server" sign, but I 
	assure you that the "circling horns" sign is well established in 
	certain areas. It also seems to be spreading.This new "WAITER" sign makes a lot of sense.  First of all, it only takes one hand (which 
	is a definite advantage -- especially when you are using the other hand to 
	hold a fork and/or cram a sandwich into your mouth). Secondly, this version 
	has a strong iconic value. By that I mean that this sign looks quite 
	a bit like what it represents --  since many waiters tend to carry 
	around trays with drinks on them.I recommend this sign to you as the sign for CATER or CATERER. Only use this 
	sign to mean "waiter" if the Deaf in your region use it.  The safe 
	thing to do is to stick with the regular sign for waiter (above).To do this sign, hold the "horns-handshape" in the air, pointing upward, and 
	circle it once or twice using a small circular movement from the elbow. (The 
	wrist stays firm.)WAITER / WAITRESS / SERVER-(restaurant/catering) / CATERER:*
