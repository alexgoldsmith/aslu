There is no widely established sign for "zebra" other than to simply sign 
  "horse" + "stripes."  I do my stripe movement by using bent five-hands, 
  but a "4" hand works well too.  When telling a story about a zebra, upon 
  first reference, I tend to sign HORSE  BLACK WHITE STRIPES STRIPES.  
  After which I shorten it to HORSE STRIPES.  The shortened version uses 
  only a single movement for "horse" and a single movement for "stripes."ZEBRA:You can learn AmericanSign
