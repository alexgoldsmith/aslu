The sign for "need" can be used to represent 
	a number of related concepts.Sign:  need / need to / must / should / ought-to / have-toHandshape:  "x"Location: In front of you, off to the right side a bit.Orientation: starts palm forward, ends palm downMovement:  "x" hand bends downward from the wristNon-Manual Marker(Facial expressions and or body language): Use a 
	stronger facial expression to indicate a greater degree of imperative.The faster, "harsher," and more exaggerated you do this sign, the
  more of a "requirement" exists to "do something." 
	If you do this sign with a single, strong movement--it means
  need as in:  must, have-to, "not much choice in the
  matter." If you use a double motion it means need as in: ought-to, should,
  "some choice in the matter.""MUST or HAVE-TO" using a single motion:The movement is downward.  Starts and ends in an "x" handshape. 
	The movement is 
	mainly in the wrist not the arm."SHOULD, OUGHT-TO"Use a double movement:"SHOULD, OUGHT-TO" (side view):MUST/HAVE-TO:Let me give you an exaggerated example of this concept showing an extreme
  "HAVE-TO":Notes:<< In a message dated 5/10/2012 6:34:36 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time, Paul

			Thus you and your friends do not need to fingerspell nor sign "to"

	into an "X" as it moves toward the person being asked.NEED: Starts as an "X" and bends at the wrist.- Dr. BillIn a message dated 8/4/2012

	and she said that instead of moving my wrist, I should move my finger into a 
	bent position, so that my finger is in the "e" position ( with my other 
	fingers remaining still.) Is this an acceptable variation?-SammyDear Sammy,I recommend you start with an "X"-handshape (the fingerspelled letter "X") 
	and then bend it downward from the wrist.If you start with a straight index finger and just bend the finger into an 
	"X"-handshape then it looks a bit like the "qm-wig" (question mark wiggle) 
	sign and/or the "ASK-to" sign.So...at the risk of getting on your mom's crap list, I'm going to have to 
	suggest that I don't think you should do it "her" way.Sorry.- Dr. Bill
