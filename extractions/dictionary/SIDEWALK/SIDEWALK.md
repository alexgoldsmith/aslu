	sign for sidewalk. I never did tell you the reason I asked for this sign. In 
	my home-town we have a policy for no skateboarding on the sidewalk near the 
	courthouse. If someone is caught skateboarding there by the local police 
	they may be cited a fine. The signs are posted, but a few of them are not 
	readily visible (sometimes I wonder if the town does this on purpose.) One 
	of my deaf acquaintances is a skateboarder, as am I. I was trying to explain 
	to him about the signs, but did not know how to sign sidewalk. But now I do, 
	thanks to your great explanation!Thank you, and Lord Bless,- Chad [name on file].*
