American Sign Language: "agent"The concept of "agent" has many variations and interpretations.Let's start with the general meaning of an agent as "apersonwho 
	does something."The sign for "person" is 
	sometimes initialized with the letter 
	"P" -- but in everyday signing there is generally no reason to use 
	the "P" handshapes. You can just use "flat" hands.When you use the PERSON-[agent] sign in combination with other signs you 
	shouldalwaysuse "flat" hands (not "P"-hands).The "PERSON-[agent]" sign in general, represents either "a person" 
	or can be added to certain verbs to indicate "a person who does" the 
	verb. 
  For example, when used with teach:  "TEACH-PERSON-[agent]" means
  "teacher."  See: TEACHERThe PERSON-[agent] sign can also be used to mean an "individual."PERSON-[agent]QUESTION:  A student posted:Hey, I've been watching the TV show "Agent Carter" and was wondering how one 
	would go about signing "agent", as in a person working for the government. 
	How would tat work?ANSWER:If we think of an agent as someone who is an official representative of a 
	government or agency that typically issues badges to their agents then we 
	could sign "agent" using a modified-C-[index_and_thumb] on the non-dominant 
	side of the chest. One contact (tap) if used as part of the designation 
	"AGENT-CARTER" or a tendency toward two taps if used as a separate noun as 
	in "She is an agent."If we use the one tap method for "SHE AGENT" it tends to take on the meaning 
	of "She is someone whom has been granted a badge and is therefore 
	representative of the agency granting the badge" -- thus either way (one or 
	two contacts) the general concept comes across for "She is an agent."Sometimes the non-initialized sign for person is referred to as the "AGENT" 
	sign. It uses flat hands that move downward and has become a popular way to 
	sign "person" (since excessive initialization is something to be avoided in 
	ASL). This "agent" PERSON-[non-initialized] sign can mean "person" in 
	general or can be used as a suffix to turn certain verbs into nouns that 
	refer to a "person who does" the action represented by the verb. For example 
	RUN-PERSON = "runner." In some descriptions you might see the same concept 
	glossed as "RUN-AGENT" which is simply another way of indicating the same 
	concept. Or you may even see: "RUN-PERSON-[agent]" which I think is very 
	specific and clear as to what you are trying to describe.If you mean "agent" as in insurance agent use "SELL-PERSON."If you mean “agent” as in someone who represents someone else you could sign 
	“SHOW-PERSON-[agent]” which ties into the concept of “representative” which 
	is also signed by using the “SHOW-PERSON-[agent]” sign.If you are referring to a chemical agent you could use a combination of 
	signs like SOIL-[substance], THING, “CAUSE-[catalyst]”, “HIT-[impact]”, 
	INFLUENCE/effect/advise, START/begin, SPREAD, CHANGE, etc. – according to 
	the specific chemical. If you are in a mixed language environment 
	[classroom, lab with Hearing coworkers] you should additionally spell AGENT 
	enough to establish the term so if it appears in writing (e.g. on a test or 
	in a document) the student or employee will recognize it.If you are referring to a “free agent” such as an athlete who is eligible to 
	contract with any franchise you could spell F-R-E-E A-G-E-N-T and then use 
	signs such as not-YET SIGNATURE-[contract/sign-up-with/register] OFFER-to-me++[various] 
	HE/SHE CAN THINK-SELF CHOOSE-[select] TEAM HE/SHE WANT JOIN.In some advanced theological (church) discussions you might sign “agent” 
	using REPLACE/instead/substitute-PERSON-[agent]. Note: the gloss “++” 
	indicates that a sign is done repeatedly.If you are using “agent” as in a “secret agent” you could sign SECRET, spell 
	A-G-E-N-T and then use the INVESTIGATE sign while using “sneaky” body 
	language.If the “agent” is someone functioning as a “go-between” you could use the 
	FACILITATE-PERSON-[agent] sign.If you are the boss and the “agent” is your assistant you could sign “MY 
	ASSISTANT.”Prior to the internet wiping out the profession of individuals who help 
	arrange travel for others we used to have “travel agents.” To indicate a 
	“travel agent” you would sign TRAVEL and spell A-G-E-N-T. If expansion is 
	necessary you would use signs like HE/SHE PLAN MY TRAVEL.
