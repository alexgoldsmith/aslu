DECLINE / "deteriorate" / "regress"This sign means the opposite of "improve."Think of your non-dominant arm as a "measuring stick."  Think of 
			your dominant hand as showing the
  level going down. You can do one big movement to show a major
  decline, or you can do smaller movements to show an incremental
  worsening of the situation.DECLINE / deteriorate / regress / go down hill(A single large movement indicates a substantial worsening of the 
			situation).Deteriorate or decline in small stages:Sample sentence:If you don't go to sign language class nor chat with Deaf, will your 
			signing go down hill?= SUPPOSE YOU NOT GO SIGN CLASS, NOT CHAT DEAF, YOUR SIGN DECLINE?DECLINE / "turn down" / 
			"reject"The concept of "declining" an invitation, application, or offer can 
			be shown several ways.  One of the most common is the good old 
			"THUMBS-DOWN" sign wherein you start with an "open-A" handshape with 
			the thumb pointed up and then you pivot the sign so that the thumb 
			is pointed down.Often the concept of "decline" (turn down an offer) is expressed by 
			using the "say-NO-to" sign -- which is a directional version of 
			"NO." (You move the sign NO in the direction of the person to whom 
			you are saying no.)DECLINE / deteriorate:Another way express the concept of "decline" or "declining" is to 
			use a version of the sign that means "to sink down" which is 
			sometimes labled as DROWNbut can mean "to get worse" or "to deteriorate."  For example: 
			"To decline in mental or physical health," or "a community in 
			decline" (i.e. area, in-decline); or "My hearing is going down 
			(declining)."This concept is shown via one or both "A" handshapes. The palms face 
			each other and thumbs point up). The hands wriggle downward, 
			simultaneously.Notes:* Special thanks to Lyn Wiley for suggesting additional versions of
