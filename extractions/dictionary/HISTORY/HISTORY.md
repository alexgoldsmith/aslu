See:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGyX9V8ek_sThe sign for "history" moves an "H" hand down, up, and 
			down again.HISTORY:  (version 2)This version means the same as the previous version.  It just adds the 
	non-dominant fist hand.  The "H"-hand (lightly) whacks the back of the 
	fist, twice.Notes:QUESTION:In a message dated 3/15/2017 12:50:35 P.M. Pacific Daylight Time, 
			Lyn (Deaf, a wordsmith, an ASL instructor, and a poet) writes:Hi Bill,Many years ago I was told the correct way to sign 'history' is as 
			follows:A dominant H handshape - fingers point straight out and palm faces 
			the non-dominant side of the body. Now, move the hand in two very 
			small circles - - if right-handed those would be clockwise circles.The logic for the circular movement, I was told, was two-fold. 
			First, to represent the unending 'cycle' of history and second, to 
			help distinguish the sign from the signs for 'hurry/hurried/haste' 
			and 'hard of hearing.'But most often (or so it seems to me) it is signed with two downward 
			movements.I see "history" signed with a circular motion on occasion but it 
			seems to me that using two downward motions is the more common way 
			to sign it?Can you tell me if both movements (circular and downward) are 
			correct? And if both are correct is the downward movement preferred?Thanks,Lyn---------------------------------------------RESPONSE:Lyn,I tend to do HISTORY using the two downward movements and a slightly 
			hyper-extended wrist:See:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGyX9V8ek_sI have seen history done on the back of the non-dominant fist using 
			the motion of a locomotive wheel axle.I've seen history done with two backward somewhat near the shoulder 
			flicks (connecting the sign to the past).But I have "not" see that circular method to which you are 
			referring.Which, of course doesn't mean it is "wrong" -- just so rare as to 
			not be something I'd teach to a college student.- BillYou can learn
