SEND (general version)SEND (throw version)Note: The "throw" version of send tends to be used for things that are more 
physical or tangible.Â  I don't use this version very often but when I 
do it is for concepts like I "sent a thank-you card to her."Sample sentence:
Does your church send out missionaries?
