NIGHT (or "evening")The sign for "night" is made by holding your non-dominant arm horizontally, 
	palm down, pointing to the side. (If you are right handed that means your 
	left arm would be pointing toward the right.) Put your dominant hand's wrist 
	on the back of your non-dominant hand, fingertips pointing down.EVERY-NIGHT:If you move the right hand along the left arm it is interpreted as meaning 
	"every night" or "nightly."GOOD-NIGHT:(basic version: non-compounded)GOODNIGHT:(advanced version: compound sign)Also see:ALL-NIGHTTONIGHT:Question: Does the sign NIGHT also 
	mean "tonight?"Answer: No. To create the meaning of 
	"tonight" we sign a combination ofNOWand NIGHT. This 
	creates the compound sign "TONIGHT."DISCUSSIONIn a message dated 3/8/2005 7:35:27 AM Pacific Standard Time, a 
			student asks:Question:  Is 
			evening and night the same thing?Answer:  Yes, but you can also modify the sign to mean early evening or late at 
		night depending on where you put the dominant hand.  Lower (pointing 
		down more) means later.
