American Sign Language:  "divorce"The sign for "divorce" is
    made by first forming the letter "d" with both hands.  Hold 
both hands together with the palms facing each other. With a twisting motion, move both hands outward and sideways so both palms face
    forward.DIVORCE (initialized-version):Memory Aid: Think of two objects or two people that were
    once together as now being apart.DIVORCE (non-initialized version):Notes:The sign for divorce is very similar to the sign for "separate" or
    "apart."  The sign for "separate" is made by touching both hands together at the knuckles.  
The hands should both be bent. Now, move the hands away from each other.SEPARATE:See:SEPARATE*
