American Sign Language: 
		"web"WEB (or "Website")  = "WW"What I typically do when I want to sign the concept "website" is I do the letter 
W twice, with an arc.Check out the video.  Note: This sign is like signing WWW except you just 
do "WW" and it seems to fill the role of the concept of the English word 
"website."*
