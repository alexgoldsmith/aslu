To sign "nation" make a clockwise circle with the 
			dominant modified-"N"-hand and set it down on top of the 
  back of the leftfist.  Some people use a "flat hand" for the 
			non-dominant hand -- that's okay too.NATION:Hmmm...I just noticed I've got a loose thumb here. Dunno why I did 
			it that way.  Trying to look official for the camera I guess. 
			Typically, yes the index and middle fingers are a bit more straight 
			than a regular "N" but the thumb is indeed usually tucked under.Animation: NATIONNotes:A student writes:QUESTION:  What is the difference between "national" 
			and "normal"?ANSWER:  Good question. NATIONAL and NORMAL are indeed 
			very similar.  I tend to do the sign for NORMAL using a bit 
			more of a "slap" type movement. I do the sign for NATIONAL with a 
			bit more of a "plant the flag" type of movement. But many of my 
			friends do those two signs the exact same. One thing I've noticed is 
			that the sign for NORMAL sometimes adds a bit of a head-nod which 
			creates a connotation of "That is normal." Also, I tend to use a 
			palm-down "fist" as my non-dominant hand but some people use a 
			palm-down flat hand as their non-dominant hand (both versions are 
			ok). - Dr. BillSee:NORMALYou can learn AmericanSign
