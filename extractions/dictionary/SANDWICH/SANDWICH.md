In the sign for "sandwich" your dominant hand is flat  and represents 
	some kind of meat or "sandwich filling."  Your non-dominant hand is 
	bent at the large knuckles and the thumb is extended forward (pointing in 
	the same direction as the fingers).  The non-dominant hand represents a 
	couple of slices of bread and looks as if it is holding a sandwich.  
	Place the meat between the two slices of bread (put your dominant hand 
	between the thumb and fingers of your non-dominant hand) and bring the 
	"sandwich" up to your mouth.SANDWICH:Note: Another way to do the above version is to place the meat 
			into the bread twice without bringing it up to the mouth.SANDWICH (version)There is yetanotherway to sign "sandwich" that places both 
			flat hands together (palms touching) and aims them at the mouth.  
			It is a bit awkward but  I consider it to be a good version for 
			talking about a "hoagie" or "submarine" type sandwich.SANDWICH (hoagie" or "submarine" version)Also see:SUBWAYYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
