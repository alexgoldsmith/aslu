The sign for"box" uses flat hands to show the sides and then bent hands to show the 
	front and back of the box.  I tend to use my non-dominant hand as the 
	outward side of the box and my dominant hand as the side nearest to my body, 
	but it really isn't an issue. You could do it the other way. The point is to 
	show the sides and then front and back of the box.BOX:Note: The sign BOX can also be interpreted as "ROOM."  While it is true 
	that there is an initialized form of the sign ROOM that uses "R" handshapes, 
	it is not necessary to initialize the sign when the meaning "of" room is 
	clear from the context of the sentence.  For example, seeBEDROOM.
