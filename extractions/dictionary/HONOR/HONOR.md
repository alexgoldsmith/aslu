HONOR:This sign uses "H" handshapes.Â  The hands move forward and up to the 
	right if your are referring "honoring God."The sign is directional. (You can show the object of the honor by the 
	direction of the sign.) For example, if you are at a luncheon and bestowing 
	an honor on an individual you would do the movement toward the individual.If you were the recipient of the award you could even do the sign backward 
	toward yourself as you thank the audience for the "honor."HONOR
