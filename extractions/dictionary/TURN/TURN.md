The right sign for "turn" is going to depend on your meaning.If you mean "turn" as in "it is the next person's turn," "second hand," 
	"used car," "alternate plan," and "step-brother" then use an "L"-handshape 
	and twist it toward the outside (or toward the person who's turn it is).  
	If you mean, "It is my turn," then twist it toward yourself and have it end 
	on your chest.TURN-(general)Animation: "TURN" (general)"My Turn"Roll an "L" hand back toward your chest.  You can actually 
			whack it up against your chest if you are adamant about it being 
			your turn. (Or if you just like whacking your chest.) (No comment.)"Your turn"Roll an "L" hand forward the person to whom you are signing. (Do NOT 
			whack them in the chest. If you do, I don't know you. Find another 
			teacher.)"Take turns" (You and I 
			go back and forth)If you mean "turn" as in turn on a computer by pushing a button then just 
	mime pushing a button with your thumb.  Or spell "on" using a somewhat 
	large movement.TURN-ON via push-button switch:The sign above would be used for old upright "desktop" style computers. You 
	should modify the angle and movement to match wherever the "on button" is on 
	your computer or device.  Note: Even though most ASL teachers avoid 
	using the "ON"-preposition sign, it is fairly 
	common for Deaf people to use the "on top of"-(preposition) sign to mean 
	"on" as in turn "on" your computer.Suppose you mean "turn" as in "turn on the the lights by flipping a switch." 
	In that case just mime flipping a light switch upward.TURN-ON via switch:If you mean "turn" as in turn off a light by flipping a switch downward then 
	use a downward movement to mime the action.TURN-OFF via switch:NOTES:There are dozens and dozens of English phrases that involve the word 
			"turn." Each of those phrases should be signed using an appropriate 
			and specific set of signs.Concepts such as "turn the car left," "she turns me on," "it turned 
			out alright," "the situation took a turn for the worse" and "the 
			Earth turns on its axis" would all be signed very differently.The topic of "turning" could take hours to cover and someday I'd 
			like to do a complete lesson on how to express the concept of 
			"turn." Feel free to donate gobs of money so I can speed up
