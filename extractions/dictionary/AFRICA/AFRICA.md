The sign for "Africa" has gone through a few political debates.  
			A long time ago it was an
  "A" circling the face.Then people started using a "loose C" handshape that uses a curved downward motion 
  while changing
  into an "AND" handshape. (Which was considered politically correct 
	and respectful since it was linked to the shape of the African continent and 
	not linked to people's faces).Some people go on a tirade if you don't sign thingstheirway.  If people in your social circle sign it one particular 
			way, by all means adopt that method but as for me, I recommend you 
			do it the "newer way"Africa:  (Newer, politically correct method) (recommended version)AFRICA (Old method) (not recommended)You can learn AmericanSign
