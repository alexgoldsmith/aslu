There are a couple of popular 
	signs for "tall."A good general sign is made by placing your right index finger on the palm of your left hand 
	(if you are right handed) and moving
the finger upward a few inches. This version is a good one to use to describe trees, 
buildings, or even people.TALL:This next version is particularly good to use for describing people but not 
	good for describing buildings.I've inflected this version to mean "verytall." You can do it 
	with less facial expression and not so high up and without the upward 
	eye-gaze to mean just "regular tall" rather than "very tall."very-TALL (basketball player height orÂ  "giant")
