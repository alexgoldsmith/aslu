In "high context" situations, the concept of "winter"Â can be 
	expressed in ASL by simply signing "COLD."Many people just sign
  "cold" when they mean "winter." That is okay as long as you can 
	figure out the meaning
  from the context of the sentence.If there is any 
	ambiguity (if it isn't clear) as to the meaning, then you can use an 
	initialized sign that uses "W" handshapes on the sign "cold."WINTER:Sample sentence: Does it snow here in the winter? = WINTER HERE SNOW?
