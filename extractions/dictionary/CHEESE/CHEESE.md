The sign for "cheese" is made by bringing both hands
      together.  Rotate your right hand (or your dominant hand) back and forth.The left hand doesn't move.Student: I don't really understand how to sign cheese...like how to
      rotate?Dr Vicars: You rotate the heel of the right hand on the palm of the left 
		-- back and forth
      as if trying to press the moisture out of a piece of cheese that is within a piece of
      cheese cloth. The butt of the right hand stays on the palm of the left. The finger tips of
      the right hand swing back and forth right to left a couple times pivoting on the 
		heel of
      the hand. The right hand fingers are relaxed--spread out just a titch and bent a little.
        Does that help?Student: Better =)CHEESE:
