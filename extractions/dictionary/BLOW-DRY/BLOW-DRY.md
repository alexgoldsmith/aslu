		blow-dry / blow-dryer / hair-dryerTo sign "blow dry" or "blow-dryer" just mime using an "L" hand as if it were a 
blow-dryer.I personally don't get much use out of this sign.BLOW DRY / BLOW-DRYER / HAIR-DRYER:For the "verb" form do the sign a bit larger = blow dry.For the "noun" form, do the sign smaller and use a sign like MY or YOUR before 
the sign and don't use the puckered lips.  Example: MY BLOW-DRY WHERE? = 
Where is my blow-dryer?Notes:Also see:HAIRDRYER[it is the same sign]*
