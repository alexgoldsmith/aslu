you will combine the signs GIRL and POLITE.LADY (version)GIRL/female + POLITE = "lady"To sign polite you brush the tip of the thumb
  of your right five-hand twice on your chest using an upward motion.  The
  hand moves in a very small circle, up, out, down, back.  It is on the
  upward stroke that the thumb-tip touches the chest.  You might see other
  versions of this sign, but this is how I do it.Also see:WOMANAlso see:GIRL*
