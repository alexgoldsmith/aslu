American Sign Language: 
		"keep"KEEP:[Use a single motion.  The right hand moves to the left hand.  The
  left hand is held slightly out from the body and remains mostly stationary.]  
  However...if I'm telling someone to "keep it" I tend to move the whole sign in 
  his or her direction as I whack the two "K" hands together.  If I'm 
  talking about myself keeping it then I do the sign close by my body.Also see:LOAN-[lend_borrow]Also see:take-CARE-ofAlso see:what-KIND-of / type-ofSample sentence: Do you keep a picture of your old boy friend?  = OLD BOY 
FRIEND PICTURE YOU KEEP?Note: A very common approach to referring to a former partner 
(such as a former boyfriend) is to spell "EX" prior to signing BOY FRIEND 
instead of using the sign OLD.I couldn't imagine someone signing "MY OLD WIFE" to mean "ex-wife." So even 
though you can use "OLD" to refer to a previous boy or girl-friend I recommend 
that youdon'tuse "OLD" for referring to former spouses.When referring to a "former but no longer" lover -- of the two signs "OLD" 
or "EX" the safer choice would be to use "EX."  My reason for including the 
sign OLD in this curriculum is to help point out that it does indeed 
occasionally express a  meaning other than "long in age."*
