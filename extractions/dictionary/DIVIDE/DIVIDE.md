American Sign Language: "divide"DIVIDE:  At first the left hand is stationary.  The right hand 
comes down an inch or two and contacts the left hand. Then both hands move 
downward and to the sides.Notes:The general sign for divide works just fine for math concepts. It is also good 
for concepts like "split."Suppose for some crazy reason you needed to sign the phrase, 
			"We've got to divide the division problems from the multiplication 
			problems."In that circumstance you could use a highly specific version of the 
			sign "DIVIDE" that is specifically related to mathematical problems.DIVIDE-(high context math situations) (not recommended for everyday 
			use).*
