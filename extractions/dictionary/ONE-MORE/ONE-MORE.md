sign "one more"? I've seen two:1) "1" handshape facing the signer and bends down twice;2) both hands are in "bent O" positions with fingertips touching and the right 
index finger moves up and down.Are there other ways of signing this? Thank you!- AntonioAntonio,You could also do two separate signs: ONE MORE.The bending and unbending index finger is the most advanced version.-Dr. BillAlso  see:MORE*
