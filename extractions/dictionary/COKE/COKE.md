I recommend you just spell the word "Coke."  There is a very 
			interesting 
	"legacy" version of the sign (see below) but it is very common to see adult native Deaf signers 
	just spell C-O-K-E.COKE (legacy version)I'm including this legacy version of the sign because you might still see it out 
there in the community and I want you to recognize it and realize that it is not 
a "joke" sign. It was used for many years. (And is still very 
popular!)The sign for "Coke" as in"Coco-Cola"looks as if you are jabbing a needle into your arm. 
	It is done by using your dominant hand index finger to poke your 
	non-dominant arm's bicep.It's true folks.  I'm not making this up! And I'm not talking about 
	"cocaine." I'm talking about the drink.COKE ("Coco-Cola" soda-pop)NOTES:COKE (as in the drink) is an interesting sign that looks like you are sticking a 
	needle in your arm.Why this is the case is debated somewhat in the Deaf world. Many people 
	think it is because of the idea of "shooting up" with Cocaine.  I've 
	been told however by more than one old Deaf codger that the sign originally 
	had to do 
	with the idea that in the old days when Deaf kids would have to go to the 
	doctor to get a "shot" they would afterward be rewarded with a bottle of 
	Coke.--Dr. Billp.s. The sign "cocaine" is totally different.  It is an "A" hand, (palm 
	left, if you are right handed) brought to the nose with a very small double 
	movement.In a message dated 4/17/2008 12:36:53 P.M. Pacific Daylight Time,

		term for a "coke" was "dope"--as in, "Give me a dope". [Presumably this
