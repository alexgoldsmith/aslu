ASL: "month"The sign for "month"
is made by pointing upward with the index finger of your non-dominant hand. If 
	you are right handed, the palm of the
left hand should face right. The palm of the right hand should face back.  Trace the right index finger from the top to the bottom of the left
index finger.MONTH:Note: You can change this sign to mean "monthly,"
"every-month," or "rent" by repeating the movement.Last month (a combination of "past" and
  month.")MONTHLY / every month:Next-MONTH:You can incorporate numbers (1 though 9) into the sign for month.SIX MONTHS:Question:  How do you sign the individual months of the year?Answer: 
Signed English has signs for the months, but in ASL we prefer to show the months of the year 
	via fingerspelling.  If the name of the month is short (five or fewer 
	letters) we spell it out. If the name of the month is long (more than five 
	letters) we abbreviate it to just three letters, except for September which 
	is done with four letters, (SEPT).Here is a list of the way the months indicated via fingerspelling in ASL:JAN, FEB, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUG, SEPT,
OCT, NOV, DEC.Some people do the sign for "month" with the dominant hand "palm down." 
	While I wouldn't mark it wrong if a student signed it that way, I wouldn't 
	recommend the "palm down" version.MONTH: (variation) (not recommended)Also see: "basic signs"Also
