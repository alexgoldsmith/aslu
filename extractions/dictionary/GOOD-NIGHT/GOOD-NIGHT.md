American Sign Language:  "goodnight"The sign "goodnight" is 
a compound of the signs GOOD and NIGHT. When you compound (join together) two 
signs you tend to reduce the movement and contacts of the original signs. 
"Goodnight" is not two signs strung together -- rather it is a single sign 
that is specifically used  to wish someone well as you separate for the 
evening.GOODNIGHT:
(advanced version: compound sign)"GOOD NIGHT"(basic version: non-compounded)Now, if you wished to tell someone that you had a really "good night" you could 
use the separate full signs "GOOD" and "NIGHT"GOOD:NIGHT:Example of the GOOD NIGHT version:Also see: "Goodnight
