The sign for "house" uses 
	"flat hands" to show the roof and walls of a house.HOUSE:Hand shape:The hand shape can be either "B" handshapes or just "flat" hands.There are a couple 
of different ways to do the sign "house."You might see house signed with the fingers pointed upward. I wouldn't sign it 
that way for everyday conversation butthis version could be used for times when you want to embellish your signing a 
bit to make it more iconic and lively. For example,I might use this version if I were 
telling a storyto a group of childrenabout a certain "house."HOUSE (version)For everyday use though,
I tend to do the sign house with the fingertips pointingforwardinstead of up.HOUSE (recommended version)Notes:House and home are two different signs. You should not use the sign "house" when 
you mean home.See:HOMEAlso seeCITYWant to help support
