American Sign Language: 
		"wish"The sign for wish is the same sign as "hungry."  This sign is made by forming 
your right hand into the letter "c."Move your hand down the middle of your chest. You don't actually have to 
touch your body but most people do.If you want to emphasize the extent that you "wish" something would happen you 
can use a bigger, stronger movement.  Just don't use a repeated movement. Only 
use a single downward movement.Some people start the sign for "wish" on the upper chest  and prefer to start 
"hungry" from a slightly lower position. I don't mess around with that. I don't 
think it is a legitimate distinction.  But if it helps as a memory aid, think of 
a "wish" coming from your heart, and hunger coming from your belly.  But, again, 
it is okay to use the same sign for both concepts.HUNGRY / WISH:Also see:HUNGRY*
