ASL: "firefighter"There is quite a bit of variationin the Deaf community regarding the sign for FIREMAN but most versions seem to 
be based on the cool hats.ASL instructors need cool hats.  I'm jealous.I've 
been informed that fireman is no longer politically correct.Thus I encourage you to go visit the "firefighter" page instead:FIREFIGHTERThe sign is the same though.  Gee.FIREMAN:Memory aid:
  Think of the big red hats that firemen (sometimes) wear.This sign uses a slight double motion.  Tap the back of the hand on your 
forehead.  Most folks do the tap twice but in a sentence you might only see 
it once.Notes:  For more information on this sign and variations, see:FIREFIGHTER-[advanced]*
