The sign for "tough" uses "bent-V" 
	hands.  The dominant hand moves downward and past the non-dominant 
	hand.TOUGH:Note: In my example above it appears that I'm moving my non-dominant hand.  
	I "am" moving it but it is more of a reflex than an intended movement.  
	You don't actually have to move the "non-dominant" hand to do this sign.  
	The non-dominant hand can stay stationary.You can also use the left "S" hand for the sign for "tough."  The 
	dominant hand strikes a glancing blow off of the top of the palm-down 
	"S-hand."TOUGH (version)Also
