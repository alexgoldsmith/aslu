			your story.POLE (Version: flagpoles, upright cylindrical objects or tubes)Note: When telling stories where you are role-playing it helps to 
			use your eyegaze to look at the objects you create.For example:POLE (Version: "conceptual poles" -- such as the "North Pole")If you want to express the concept of "pole" as in "the North Pole"
