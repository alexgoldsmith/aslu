The appropriate sign for "corner" depends what kind of 
			corner you are referring to. In general what you do is you use 
			"flat"-hands ("B"-hands) to show a corner, (as in the corner of a 
			room or the corner of a city block).  However, if you are 
			talking about the corner of a picture (on the wall) you would 
			instead use an "L"-hand (or two index fingers) and do the sign 
			horizontally (up in the air).CORNER:See animation:  "corner"You can learn
