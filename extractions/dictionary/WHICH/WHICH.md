WHICH:Alternate holding up one "A" hand, and then the other.Remember, when asking "WH"-type questions (using signs such as WHICH, WHY, 
	WHO, WHERE, etc.) you should furrow your eyebrows while doing the sign as 
	part of the question. Also, the handshapes are "loose-thumb"-"A"-handshapes. 
	By that I mean, the thumbs are not tucked close to the rest of the hand.Note: The video is high definition. If it looks fuzzy, change 
	your configuration settings to 720 or better.Signing Notes:Note: If you were not asking a question but instead just making a statement 
	such as "I don't know which" -- you should not furrow your eyebrows while 
	doing the sign WHICH.  Only furrow your brows if you are actually 
	asking a question.Hermisaurus asks:Question:When asking a question such as "Do you want milk or juice?" Instead of a body shift 
	to show "or," could you ask "which one"? I've seen "Do you want red or 
	green, which one? " Is that correct?"Answer:Just as there are multiple "right" ways to ask a question in English, there 
	are likewise multiple right ways to ask a question in ASL.Your signing choices depend on whether you wish to be succinct or verbose.Succinct = brief and clear.Verbose = "using more words (or signs) than are needed."If we sign: "YOU WANT MILK OR-[bodyshift] JUICE?" the bodyshift can be very 
	small and start half-way through your sign for milk and end half way through 
	your sign for juice -- thus taking up almost no time at all. When we add 
	"furrowed eyebrows" near the end of the sentence the furrowed eyebrows 
	convey the meaning of "which."You can choose to sign in a succinct manner bynotadding the sign "WHICH" since you have 
	already expressed the concept of "which" via your furrowed eyebrows.   You 
	can choose to sign in a verbose manner by adding the signs "WHICH ONE" at 
	the end of your sentence -- but you shouldstillfurrow your eyebrows 
	since you are asking a "WH"-type question.If you sign the question with raised eyebrows while signingboththe 
	sign MILK and the sign JUICE you are in effect asking two questions -- both 
	of which are yes/no-type questions:Do you want milk?Do you want juice?If you use a yes/no-question approach it puts responsibility on your 
	conversation partner to respond by signing one of the two options (or using 
	the sign "BOTH" if he/she is a pig).;-)- Dr. Bill
