The sign for "in-law" is generally done by just 
	adding "LAW" after signing the person.For example:"BROTHER-in-LAW" is a combination of BROTHER 
  and LAW.  That means it is a "compound" sign. You generally get rid of  
  the first part of the sign LAW. Some people even get rid of the last half of 
  the sign brother.BROTHER: (This is a popular version of the sign "brother.")LAW:This is how I recommend you sign "brother-in-law"Sign brother, then place an L on the palm:Now, check this out.BROTHER-IN-LAW:When you see "in-law" as part of a phrase such as "brother in-law" youmightsee it drastically shortened to include only the first part of the sign for 
  brother and the last part of the sign for law.SISTER-IN-LAW:When you see "in-law" as part of a phrase such as "sister in-law" you might 
  see it drastically shortened to include only the first part of the sign for 
  sister (girl) and the last part of the sign for law.IN-LAW:  Here is an "English" way to show "in-law."  You just sign 
  "in" and then sign "law."But please note that most of the time the sign "in" is dropped when you are 
  signing compound concepts like "brother in-law." (see above).  
  I don't know of anyone who would actually sign "IN" plus "LAW"Animation: IN-LAWAnimation:  Brother
