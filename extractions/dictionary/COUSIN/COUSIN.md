cousinShake a "C" by the side of your head.This sign is similar to niece/nephew except that it uses a "C" handshape.Often students ask if you do it lower (near the cheek) to mean "girl" and 
higher (near the temple) to mean "boy."No, there is no distinction.Â  Just hold a "C" up to 
the side of your head and twist it twice.COUSIN:
