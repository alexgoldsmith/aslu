Close Captioning is a system of putting subtitles on video programming. Close-captioning is “hidden” unless decoded by a special chip in your monitor.
  In the "old days" we used to use special decoder boxes that attached
  to our TV's.  Then a law was passed that required  TV's with screens 
  over 13 inches to have a
  built-in decoder chip.The movement is a little bounce from left to right. (If you are right 
	handed.)CLOSE-CAPTIONED:Sample sentence:  Is your TV 
	close captioned?There is a sign that means "captions" or "captioning." This version is 
	based on and looks a lot like the sign for "STORY."  But there is a 
	subtle difference.  The wrists bend slightly and the hands angle as if 
	applying cellophane tape to a wall.  This sign carries a meaning of 
	"sentences on the screen" or "captioning."CAPTIONING:"captioning" animated:
