The sign for BULLY:Side view:erin_nix@s writes:Dr. Bill,Is there one accepted sign for bully? Especially one that would be 
			used in an elementary school.Thank you for your help!Sincerely,E. NixHello Erin,Yes, there is a specific 
			sign for "bully."  It forms "horns" on the dominant hand (as a 
			"Y" hand) and then presses the knuckles of that hand up against the 
			non-dominant upright flat-hand palm and twists the dominant hand 
			twice (the non-dominant hand doesn't move).- Dr. BillSentence: Have you ever
