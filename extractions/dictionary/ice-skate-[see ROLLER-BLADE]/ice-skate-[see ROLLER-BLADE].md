The sign for "rollerblading" uses "flat hands" to 
			represent the forward and back movement of your feet and the 
			roller-blade wheels. Hold your hands out in front of you with the 
			tips of your fingers pointing forward. I start with my dominant hand 
			forward (but I don't think which hand you start with is really and 
			issue).  Then I pull (glide?) my dominant hand back at the same 
			time as I I glide my non-dominant hand forward. Then I pull my 
			non-dominant hand back as I move my dominant hand forward and that's 
			it.  Basically a "one" "two" movement.  This is the same 
			movement that is used for signs like "skating" or "ice-skating."ROLLERBLADE (or "rollerblading")See:ICE-SKATESee: "SKATING"You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
