This sign can mean typical, ordinary, and "of course."While the movement can go either way, I'm going to recommend you do it with 
a clockwise movement that spirals up and then drops down. But of course you 
should do it however your local instructor or Deaf friends do it.NORMAL:Here's an example of the movement going the other direction.Again, you will see it both ways, but "today" I'm advocating you do it like 
the way I do in the first example above (use a clockwise movement).
