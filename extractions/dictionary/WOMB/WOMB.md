				language.Could you please help me find a sign for 'womb'?  I can't seem 
				to find it in the ASL dictionary or in 'Signing Made Easy" text 
				books.If you can help, thank you.  If not, I will simply [spell] the 
				word.  It is in a Christian song and it would have to be signed 
				quickly in order to keep pace with the melody.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,SandyHi Sandy,There is no "widely established" sign for womb. I asked my wife and she 
	didn't have a specific sign for it either.  She started making up some 
	weird sign like doing a mini-cradle in the belly. Heh. I thanked her for her 
	time andexcusedmyself.If I were discussing this in a workshop, I'd spell it on first reference and 
	then I'd use the following sign to indicate the relative shape and location 
	of a "womb."  Is that the "right" sign.  Not necessarily. In the 
	context of the workshop and considering that I associated the sign with the 
	concept--everybody at that workshop would likely develop a consensus that it 
	was a "good enough" sign for womb.  But I couldn't walk up to a 
	colleague and do that sign "out of context" and expect him or her to 
	understand.Also, since you are doing a song, you have a bit more poetic license and 
	might want to consider just signing "pregnant" 
	using the interlaced fingers version.-- Dr. Bill*
