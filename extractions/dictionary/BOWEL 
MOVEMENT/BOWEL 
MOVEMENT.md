bowel movement / crap / poopLoosely grab the dominant "five hand" thumb with the base hand.Then move the dominant hand downward, representing...er...well you get the 
picture.The base hand stays (for the most part) stationary.Â  The movement is all in 
the dominant hand.Some people misuse this sign to mean 
the swear word "sh_t."But honestly folks this sign is the same sign I used with my kids when they were 
little to ask if they needed to "go poop."The above signisn'ta swear word. The swear word "sh_t" has a completely 
different movement, starting position, and ending position. Plus the swear word 
version of the sign uses an angry or disgusted facial expression.
