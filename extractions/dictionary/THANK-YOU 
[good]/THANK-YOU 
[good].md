The sign for "thank you" is 
		made by starting with the fingers of your dominant hand near your lips.  
		Your hand should be a "flat hand."  Move your hand forward and a 
		bit down in the direction of the person you are thanking.  Smile 
		(so they'll know you mean it).THANK YOU:Memory aid:  Imagine blowing a kiss to the person you 
are thanking. (Don't pucker up -- unless you'd like to get to know him better.)The sign "THANK YOU" can also 
		be interpreted to mean "good." (Especially if you are holding a sandwich 
		in one hand.)For more information (about the sign good, not about the sandwich) see 
		the "good" page.Student:  I saw a Deaf person do this sign with two hands. Does 
		that mean something different?Dr. Bill:  If you use two hands with this sign it means you are 
		"very" grateful.  (Or perhaps you are signing to a large audience.)
