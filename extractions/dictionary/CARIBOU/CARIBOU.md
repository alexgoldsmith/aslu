The sign for "caribou" is based on the showing of "antlers."CARIBOU:My wife, Belinda, was nice enough to piece together that graphic 
			(above).I'm sure you'll agree, that is onefinelooking 
			graphic.What you won't get agreement on (in the Deaf Community) is exactly 
			how to sign the difference between "deer," "caribou," and "moose" -- 
			or if there is any difference at all!But since you are "here" I'm going to tell you my opinion.I do the sign "CARIBOU" with a fairly large forward curving 
			movement.  The sign for "caribou" looks a lot like the sign forDEER.  I personally tend to just 
			set my hands (each in a "5" shape) on my head for the sign DEER but 
			some people do the "deer" version a bit more "up and out."  
			Both of these signs look quite a bit like "MOOSE." 
			I do the sign for "moose" going further to the sides and not very 
			much to the front.For those of you who are a bit like me and want to know the 
			"back-story" to things, I dug up the following graphic posted byAllison Gober:Picture source: Gober, Allison, 2013, April 9, "Deer Differences,"
