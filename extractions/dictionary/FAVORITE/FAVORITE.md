The sign for "favorite" can be used to mean: favorite, favor, 
	prefer, and similar meanings.I've seen it used to mean "type" in the sentence:  "She's not my type."If you do the sign a bit higher using a single movement on the lips it can 
	mean "taste."FAVORITE:Use a lightjabbingmovement.See:RATHER
