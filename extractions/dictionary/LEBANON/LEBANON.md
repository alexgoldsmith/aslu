	using the same L-handshape as if to say it is a "L" tree.the last but not the least is to reverse the sign for "meeting" in opposing 
	direction as to make a tree-shape from both hands and then move away from 
	each other to close down twice towards each thumb-this sign could be 
	difficult to describe here but it appears to be an old sign fading into 
	disuse now..thank you for asking and have a good day.--Lyes BousseloubASL Faculty-CSUSEureka Hall 3116000 J streetSacramento, CA 95819
