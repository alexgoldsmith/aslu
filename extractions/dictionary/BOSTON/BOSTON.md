There are a couple of ways to sign "BOSTON."The general "main" way I'm going to recommend is to hold a "B" in front of you then 
			move it to the it to the right (if you are right handed) and then down. 
			Note: If you are Deaf (native and/or a "highly" skilled ASL signer) 
			and you are fromBostonif you disagree with the following 
			version of this sign please do let me know. (Dr. Bill)BOSTON:Animated: BOSTONByron Cantrell also tends to use the "7" movement path. He does it 
			even larger than I do.BOSTON:(Byron Cantrell)Notes:The other way to sign "Boston" is to move a "B" handshape downward twice.Warning: If you are chatting with someone in 
  California and they do this sign...it willprobablybe interpreted as 
			meaning "Berkeley, California." 
			(Especially if you are talking about old Deaf Schools.)If you are chatting with someone in the Northeast 
	who does a sign with a "B" handshape that uses this "down, up, down" 
	movement he or she probably means, "Boston, Massachusetts."The "B" hand bounces downward slightly using a "down, up, down" movement. The 
  movement is about 3 or 4 inches.BOSTON:(variation) (also means "Berkeley, California)Animated: Boston (version 2)You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
