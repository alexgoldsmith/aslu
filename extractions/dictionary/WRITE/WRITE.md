	the palm of the left hand.WRITE:Notes:The tip of the index finger is touching the dip of the thumb.This sign can also be done using a "downward" writing movement 
	instead of a sideward movement.  The non-dominant hand does not move.You could use a quick, downward movement of the dominant hand to sign write 
	as in, "I wrote a paper."Or you could use a couple of repeated movements.Sample sentence: Do you like to write research papers?However, if you wanted to sign "write your name" you would use a 
	single 
	sideward movement and do it a bit more carefully.
