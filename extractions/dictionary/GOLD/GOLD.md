To do the sign for "gold" pointyour index finger at your ear lobe and then move your hand away from your ear 
	as you change the handshape into the letter "y." End with a very 
	small shake.GOLD:Also see:SILVERNotes:The sign for "gold" is seems pretty likely based on the concept of a "gold 
	ear ring."  You point to where the ear ring is at (your ear lobe) and 
	then you indicate that it is yellow.Sometimes students tell me that their local teacher or Deaf friend does the 
	sign GOLD by using a "G"-hand instead of a "Y"-hand and they want to know 
	which version is "right."Of course you should sign "GOLD" however it is signed in your local Deaf 
	community (native multi-generational signers). If you want to get an "A" in 
	your ASL class you should of course do it however your instructor likes to 
	see it done.I will suggest however that the "G"-hand version is considered more of an 
	English-like sign.I think it is good to know and recognizebothversions but Irecommendmy own students stick with the classic "Y"-hand version 
	because of its strong ties to the sign for CALIFORNIA ("the golden state").See:CALIFORNIA
