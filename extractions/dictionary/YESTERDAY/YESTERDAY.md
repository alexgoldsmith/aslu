YESTERDAY:YESTERDAY: version 2Here is another way to sign "YESTERDAY" that uses a "Y"
  handshape.  Irecommendyou just stick with using the "A"
  handshape--because there are those who will say the "Y" handshape
  indicates you are using "signed English" and not ASL.  Oh
  phooey. I see awesome Deaf signers using the "Y" version as their
  "version of choice."  Just because a sign is
  "initialized" doesn't mean it is automatically "English on the
  hands."
