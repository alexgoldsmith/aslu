American Sign Language: "The 
		perfect one for me."Dr Bill,My name is Kim and I have to say I am so happy to have found 
				your website American Sign language University. I wanted to take 
				ASL in school but my school only offers spanish and mandrin so I 
				didn't have that choice. But now that I found this website, I 
				can learn it, and at my own pace which is actually a lot easier 
				for me.I do have a question to ask you.I know how to count to 10 in ASL so I know what the #1 looks 
				like. However, what if I wanted to sign "one "as in"that boy is the perfect one for me"? would I use the 
				same sign as the #1?I am so glad I found your website. It is amazing. Thank you for 
				reading this email, and I look foward to learning more ASL from 
				it.KimReply:Kim,Actually, in ASL you'd sign something like WE-2 MATCH! -- using a large, strong 
movement, and a "very satisfied, affirmative" look on your face.It will be a while before you can start "interpreting" ASL. For now just focus 
on going through the lessons and getting a feel for the language.- BillSee:PERFECTSee:BOYSee:MATCHNotes:*
