The sign for "garbage" is based on the idea of showing a 
	"garbage bag" hanging from your arm (as if you were going around picking up 
	garbage and putting it in your bag).GARBAGE / trash:Sample sentence: 
	"Who takes out the garbage at your house?" = YOUR HOUSE, GARBAGE, WHO 
	THROW-out?THROW-it-away / THROW-it-into-the-trash:Throw into the garbage:Notes:In a message dated 6/9/2007 3:45:45 PM Pacific Daylight Time, lamarrtodd@ writes:I am curious, the sign on

		Note: The "ASL Browser's" sign for trash or garbage (as of June 9, 2007) is generally considered 
		in other parts of the country to be the sign for 
		"metal."  I think if you ask 10 or more Deaf people indifferentareas of the country you will find the majority supporting the version at Lifeprint as 
		being fairly "standard."Additionally, the "ASL Brower's sign for "metal" (as of 
		June 9, 2007) is what 
		"most" Deaf people use as the sign for: "ceramic, 
		porcelain, cement, tooth, dentist, and one of the signs for glass."Note:  The ASLpro.com sign for "garbage" 
		(as of June 9, 2007)
		shows a combination of "DIRTY" and a classifier depicting a large 
		cylinder--which is obviously intended to mean a "garbage can."   Their sign for "garbage disposal" uses a regionally narrow 
		variation of the sign garbage that is commonly used in many states to mean "LETTUCE 
		or cabbage" followed by a widely accepted 
		sign for disposal-"grind up."Note: I encourage you to interact with a large number of Deaf people 
		from a wide variety of backgrounds. In doing so you will start to 
		recognize which sign variations arewidelyused and understood by 
		the largest audience.  As time goes on you keep adding to your own repertoire of variations that you recognize. For example, there is 
		a lesser known (rare) variation of "garbage" that touches an "8" or "F" hand to the nose and then flicks the hand outward 
		while opening up into a "5" hand.Cordially,-

	which used primarily ASLPro.I noticed while clicking around there was a conversation over the sign 
	commonly used for TRASH. In my personal experience, I have noticed the 
	under-the-chin-metal-twice sign used primarily in Midwestern states, 
	specifically in Michigan. Most people I know who signed in Michigan used the 
	under-chin sign. I don't know whether this is still the case, as I have been 
	gone for about 6 years now, but I know this was the case around 2010. 
	Perhaps it was simply a regional sign that has gone out of style? I thought 
	I would just offer my experience, as I know that sign still slips out once 
	in a while for me (oops!)Thank you,--Jacqueline NormanEducational InterpreterArizona State Schools for the Deaf and the BlindIn a message dated 4/30/2008 5:15:30 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time,
