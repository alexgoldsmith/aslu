The sign for "angry"
is made by forming "claw" hands and placing your fingertips against your
stomach.  Pull both hands forcefully up and outward.ANGRY:VERY IMPORTANT:  Use an angry facial expression.Memory hint: "As if being so mad you could rip
your guts out."Sandy:  "Aren't the thumbs extended?"Dr Bill:  Good point. I just signed this to myself and I noticed that Idouse an "extended" thumb at the beginning of this sign. Then as I pull the sign up and slightly
away from the body my fingers and thumbs flex a bit.  The fingers bend at
the second and third knuckles but not at the first knuckle (large knuckles).  
	Funny, I also just noticed that I tend to bend my left thumb but not my 
	right. I reckon that counts as a "speech impediment" of some kind. Time for 
	therapy eh?YOU FEEL ANGRY YOU?For more information see:Angry/Mad advanced discussion.Also see: "MAD"
