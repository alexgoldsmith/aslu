Afuture teacher writes:Dear Dr. Vicars,I am trying to learn ASL basics since I will be in a Elementary 
			general classroom and with inclusion, children of every kind are now 
			welcome in the general classroom regardless of their disability and 
			I want to try to prepare for the day when I have a hearing impaired 
			student.The issue has become personal recently as the 4 year old daughter of 
			a friend of mine has gotten to the point in her hearing loss where 
			it was recommended she start learning ASL. I realized then the 
			importance of knowing at least the basic ASL for my future students 
			because of her and her mother's struggle with her pre-school 
			teacher, so I began learning how to fingerspell. I envy your 
			dexterity because my hands really cramp up after an hour of 
			practice! Anyway, I ran into a pickle today. We are learning about 
			different common lessons in the elementary classroom when writing a 
			professional letter (like this one) came up. I went to your site and 
			to google to try to find out how to sign common greetings and 
			closings. I was very surprised to find that I couldn't find a thing! 
			Are there ways to sign things like this [(Dear Dr. Vicars, ), (To 
			whom it may concern, ), (Sincerely, ), and (With deepest sympathy, 
			)] or do none exist?I ask this because lessons in writing professional letters actually 
			start before the children have much experience with spelling (it is 
			a class activity that starts in Kindergarten). I assume it would be 
			just as hard on a small child to decipher a big new word I finger 
			spelled to them as it would be for any child deciphering a big 
			written word at that age. If my assumption is incorrect, please let 
			me know.Sincerely,- Jamie AllenDear Jamie,Since written forms of ASL are not widely used within the Deaf 
			community, the typical forms of "address" you might see in written 
			English communication are not common in American Sign Language.Let's consider the word "dear" in the phrase, "Dear Mr. Smith."In general, the sign LOVE (arms crossed over chest) or the sign 
			PRECIOUS (claw hand changes to "S" hand) are the two closest 
			concepts to "dear." There is also a sign that means "I love love it" 
			which is known as "KISS-FIST" wherein a person kisses the back of 
			their fist.But really none of those concepts matches the English concept of 
			"Dear John Smith." Realistically "dear" at the beginning of a letter 
			or email doesn't mean the person is "dear" to you but rather it 
			means you are being cordial and showing a bit of politeness and/or 
			respect. Thus in an effort to bridge a non-bilingual ASL child over 
			to become a bilingual ASL/English fluent child you will need to use 
			signs such as "IT MEANING RESPECT [body-shift "OR"] POLITE.Let me turn this around a bit. When two individuals pass by each 
			other in the hall or on the street they sometimes nod their head 
			toward the other person. What does that nod mean? How would you 
			write it? If I were to ask you to give me a one-word English 
			equivalent to the "head nod while passing on the street" gesture it 
			would be rather challenging. I suppose we could try to say that the 
			"nod" means "hello" but that would be superficial. it obviously 
			means more than.The "nod" when done while passing is a gestural form of "addressing" 
			the other person -- a way to show that you acknowledge their 
			existence. It conveys the concept that I respect you enough to nod 
			my head a bit. It is quite possible that the "nod" is descendant 
			from an actual "bow" which obviously means more than just "hello."Some concepts are so culturally laden with meaning that they willnottranslate easily into some other culture's "nearest" words. 
			The word "Dear" in the title of address isn't just a "word" it is 
			part of a phrase. The moment you try to break the word "Dear" apart 
			from its phrase you've already ruined your best hope for finding an 
			equivalent translation in another language. The phrase "Dear Mr. 
			Smith," over time has changed to mean something quite different from 
			the English words "Mr. Smith is dear to me."Thus I suggest that a way to teach the meaning of "Dear Mr. Smith" 
			to culturally Deaf ASL-speaking is to show them an overhead picture 
			of a piece of correspondence, "START MAIL PROPER HOW-(rhetorical)? 
			QUOTE D-E-A-R M-R S-M-I-T-H COMMA QUOTE." Or even "SUPPOSE YOU WANT 
			WRITE / TYPE MAIL or EMAIL SOMEONE. START HOW? FIRST SENTENCE 
			TEND-to WHAT-DO? I OFFER GOOD WAY YOU WRITE D-E-A-R M-R S-M-I-T-H 
			COMMA.Such explanations can help bridge the gap when you are instructing 
			Deaf native ASL users who are the children of Deaf parents who use 
			ASL. If your students don't "really" know ASL and simply know a bit 
			of home-signing or Signed English that their Hearing parents use at 
			home then the discussion regarding how to sign "Dear Mr. Smith" is a 
			moot one and your best use of time isn't worrying about how to sign 
			it in ASL.Instead you should focus on developing a learning process whereby 
			you are able to communicate such concepts to your Deaf and hard of 
			hearing students visually through the use of actual examples, 
			pictures, pieces of correspondence.Learning a few hundred signs online is a "good start" but it doesn't 
			replace the thousands of hours of training and practice necessary to 
			become fluent enough in ASL to effectively explain "deep" concepts. 
			If your students' residual hearing is not sufficient to enable 
			effective communication via speech (even with amplification) then I 
			encourage you to make sure they receive skilled signing provided by 
			either a certified interpreter and/or a certified Teacher of the 
			Deaf.And even if becoming a terp or an instructor of the Deaf is not be 
			your thing, I am still very glad to see you making an effort to 
			brighten the lives of your future students.Best wishes for your progress and success.Cordially,Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
