      to teach my young students?The sign PEANUT-BUTTER is a combination of PEANUT and BUTTER.When signed as part of PEANUT-BUTTER the sign BUTTER uses a single movement 
    instead of a double movement.To sign peanut, put the tip of your thumb behind your two front teeth then move your hand 
  forward about 6 inches (which causes the thumb to drag a bit on the bottom 
  edge of your two front teeth as you move the hand forward). During high speed 
	signing you don't actually have to touch your teeth -- you just come close 
	to it. Then do a one-movement version of "butter" by dragging the tips of 
	the index and middle fingers of an open-H hand across the non-dominant palm.PEANUT-BUTTER:Animation:peanut-butterSee:BUTTERSee:JELLYSee:SANDWICHYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
