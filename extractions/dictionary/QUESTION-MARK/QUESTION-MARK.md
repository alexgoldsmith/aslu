American Sign Language: "Question 
		Marks"Daniel Hodson writes:Hi Dr. Bill. On some other ASL-related sites, students are instructed to use the 
ASK-to sign at the end of any question, as a "I'm asking for a response" 
indicator. I've never seen you do this. Is it necessary? It seems redundant to 
use a "wh"-question word and also have to signal that you're asking a question.Thanks.- Daniel------------------------------Hello Daniel,You are right. Adding a manual signal (such as a QM-wig) to the end of a 
sentence that already uses facial grammar (such as raised or lowered eyebrows) 
to indicate that you are asking a question -- is redundant.QM-wig should be used sparingly and only for situations when you wish to either 
clarify that a complex sentence is indeed a question and/or you want to add an 
element of skepticism (via a combination of the QM-wig sign and a disbelieving 
facial expression).See:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIfbve2UfKMThink of QM-wig as similar to the question phrase "Is that so?" Then think of 
all the ways you could modulate "Is that so?"--by changing your facial 
expressions and tone of voice. Thus you can see that QM-wig can have a range of 
meanings.  It should not be used at the end of every question.Dr. Vp.s.
There is a difference between "ASK-to" and "QM-wig" (question-mark wiggle).ASK-to:Start with an index-finger handshape, move your hand toward the person being 
asked, and change your handshape into an "X"-hand (pointed toward that person at 
a loose angle).Notes:See:QM-wigSee:ASK-to*
