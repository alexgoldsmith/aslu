The sign for "bridge" (as in a "raised pathway") uses 
			the non-dominant arm to represent the driving or walking surface of 
			the bridge and the dominant arm to represent the underlying supports 
			of the bridge.  The non-dominant hand is (more or less) 
			horizontal. The non-dominant handshape is not overly important.  
			I use a flat hand for my non-dominant handshape but you can use a 
			fist and it still means "bridge."BRIDGE:You can learn
