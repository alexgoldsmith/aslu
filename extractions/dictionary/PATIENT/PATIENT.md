			endure until later" then you can use the version of "patient" that 
			is done on the chin:PATIENT:Put your thumbnail on your chin and drag it downward about 2 inches.SUFFER:This sign is similar to PATIENT except the sign SUFFER uses a twisting 
  movement as it moves downward.If you mean "patient" as in a person who is under the care of a 
			medical professional, then you can make a cross on your shoulder 
			with a "P" handshape:PATIENT-(medical)Sample sentence:  Nurse Katie likes me best! I'm a good
