Version 1:Hold up an index finger in the neutral fingerspelling position. The finger 
	is pointing up, the palm-side of the hand is facing forward. Make a twisting 
	rotational movement and end up with the palm-side of the hand facing 
	backward towards yourself.  The movement is somewhat similar to running 
	your fingertip along the inside of an upside-down bowl of leftover frosting 
	so as to get some left-over frosting onto your fingertip (so you can stick 
	it in your mouth -- of course).This version is commonly used to mean "just" 
			as in "there is just one left."JUST / ONLY:Version 2:To sign this version of "only" hold an index-hand palm up (the 
			index finger is pointing up, the flat of the fingernail is toward 
			the viewer).  Move the hand in a small horizontal circle as if 
			drawing a circle the size of a quarter on the underside of a table.  
			This sign also means "someone / something / single.""ONLY"  = SOMEONE / SOMETHING / SINGLE:See:SINGLEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
