American Sign Language: "bell 
		/ ringing / alarm"Notes:  The "thing" that hangs down in the middle of a bell is called a 
"clapper."  Think of this sign as showing the clapper striking the inside 
wall of the bell.  Use a single larger movement to mean "ring" and change 
the wiggle the clapper as you pull it away from the bell to indicate the nature 
of the ringing. If it is a quick, shrill ringing, then repeat the movement many 
times using a fast, small movement.  If it is a loud sound then use a more 
forceful bang against your hand. If the sound of the bell "resonates for a 
while"-- you can show this after the initial "clap" against the hand by dragging 
the clapper through the air off to the right while shaking the "Q"-handshape a 
couple times.A version of this sign is done with theindex finger pointing up instead 
of down.  That version can also be used to indicate general "ringing" 
or an "alarm."Sign: BELLA colleague writes:"... in preparation for a performance party with my ASL 3 students, 
			I am having them do "I Heard the Bells"... an old Christmas favorite 
			of mine. ... [The song has the word] "BELL"   followed immediately 
			by "RINGING"... how  is the best way to handle this?Reply:Show the inital clap of the bell, and then drag the clapper through the air a 
	bit showing the reverberation of the ringing in the air.(Sort of like the 
	sign "green" heh).Here is an animated gif example:--modify the ringing to meet your needs.  For example, you could do a 
double clap of the ringer for "bells" and then do the reverberation for ringing 
and time it to match the tempo of the song.Remember:  The "alarm" 
version points theindex finger up, not down, and uses several quick movements.*
