			mean "relax" (but most of the time, "relax" is initialized with an 
			"R" -- see below).The sign for "rest" crosses the arms over the chest. The 
			hands are "loose" hands. The sign starts by touching the upper chest 
			and then visibly "relaxing" the hands and arms so they lay more flat 
			on your chest.REST:The sign for "relax" is an initialized version of the sign "REST."You don't have to initialize this sign.  In context you can just use the

	this "R"-handed version I think you should know it.RELAX:You can learn AmericanSign
