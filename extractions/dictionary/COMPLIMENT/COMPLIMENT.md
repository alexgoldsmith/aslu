The sign for compliment is a modified version of the sign for SCHOOL 
			and/or CLAP.  The difference between the two signs is that the 
			sign for compliment is done a bit softer and the contact is more 
			from the finger area of the dominant hand to the palm area of the 
			non-dominant hand, (not so much palm to palm contact as in the 
			general sign for SCHOOL).Also the sign COMPLIMENT is sometimes held a bit more out from the 
			body -- especially if you are complimenting someone directly (done 
			slightly in the direction of the person receiving the compliment).COMPLIMENT:Also, you could express the concept of "compliment" via other 
			methods such as informing someone that someone else had said 
			somethingPOSITIVEabout them orNICEabout them.See:SCHOOLYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
