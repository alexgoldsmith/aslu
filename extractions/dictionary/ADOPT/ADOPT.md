Note: This sign can also mean: "EVAPORATE." For extra effect the 
			"EVAPORATE" version works especially well if youmake a slurping movement with your mouth while doing this sign.  
			Just do the slurping movement, no need to make thenoiseof 
			slurping, after all, we are Deaf.Hey, that brings up another topic. Sooner or later you are going to 
			come across a Deaf person that sounds like a wet-vac while eating. 
			If you are not this person's mother then I recommend you focus on 
			not dribbling your food on your shirt rather than trying to play 
			Miss Manners. (Brings to mind something about a "mote" and a 
			"beam.")Also see:TAKEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
