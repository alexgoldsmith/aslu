The sign for "future" is made by slicing a "flat hand" 
	forward through the air.  The farther you move your hand, the further 
	into the the future you are referring.  This sign can also mean such 
	things as "WILL" as in, "Will you go to college?" (YOU FUTURE COLLEGE YOU?).  
	You can also use a double arching movement to mean "someday" or "the distant 
	future."  If you do a single large strong movement it can mean "a long 
	time from now."FUTURE:"FUTURE-[someday] YOU MAYBE BECOME NURSE?"Far in the future:Use a bigger movement that goes farther.Also see:SOMEDAYAlso see:LATER
