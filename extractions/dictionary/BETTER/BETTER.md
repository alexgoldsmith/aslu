of the mouth (not actually touching) and comes out to the right a bit. (Assuming you are right handed). 
The shape changes from a flat hand into an "A" hand with a loose thumb.BETTER:Notes:"BETTER" and "BEST" are actually versions of "GOOD."Memory Aid:  An interesting way to think of "BETTER" is as a combination of
"GOOD + ER," and "BEST" as a combination of "GOOD +

The more you exaggerate this sign, the more your are emphasizing how much 
better something is than the others thus it may dip down a bit for emphasis 
prior to moving "way up."BEST:
