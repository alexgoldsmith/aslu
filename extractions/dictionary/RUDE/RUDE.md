			non-dominant flat hand, palm up. The dominant hand is in a 
			"25"-handshape (which is a "5"-handshape with the middle finger 
			extended at the knuckle). Slide the tip of the dominant hand middle 
			finger forward over the length of the non-dominant palm.RUDE:Animation: RUDENote:If you do the sign RUDE with the non-dominant hand palm down, it 
			instead means "naked/empty/available."Memory aid: "It is rude to go to class naked."(Which I have yet to do mind you. I'm just saying.)You can learn AmericanSign
