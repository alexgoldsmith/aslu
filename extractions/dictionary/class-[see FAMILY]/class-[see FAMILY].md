The sign for "family" is based on a general circle movement 
	that applies to similar signs such as: family, class, group, and team.  
	You show the difference between these signs by using initialization (use the 
	first letter of the represented word as the handshape for the sign).To sign "family" form "F" hands and use the hands to trace 
the shape of a circle.  As if representing a family sitting around a dinner 
table.FAMILY:FAMILY DEAF? = "Is anyone in your family Deaf?"CLASS:  As in, I can't wait to go to Dr. Bill's ASL class!"(Can also be used for "category.")Note:  If you do the sign CLASS with "looser" fingers, it can mean a 
"general group of things." I call this the "CLUSTER" 
sign. It is often used to show  plurality or to 
show a "group of things."GROUP:TEAM:
