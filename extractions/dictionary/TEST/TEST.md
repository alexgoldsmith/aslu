The sign for "test" has several different "pronunciations."Okay, in this situation "pronounce" means "articulate" which means "how 
	you do" this sign.There are several ways to "do" the "TEST" sign. 
  All of them focus on the idea of showing a type of "question mark."  
  This generally is based on starting with a straight index finger changing into 
	an "x" finger while moving downward as if drawing a question mark in the air 
	and then "dotting it."A very common version of the sign TEST starts with index fingers 
  straight, then bends them into "x" handshapes as the hands move downward. Then 
  the hands change into palm-down "5" handshapes.TEST:Sample sentence: Do you like true/false tests?Another version of "TEST" starts with index fingers, moves the hand downward and 
  changes into "x" hands, then changes back into straight 
  index fingers and moves down a bit more while changing into "x" hands a second 
  time.I use this version to mean "quiz" but it is common to see it used to mean 
	"test."TEST or
	QUIZ:Notes:Realistically though, there is a strong chance your local instructor will 
	just spell Q-U-I-Z.Also see:EXAMAlso see:INVESTIGATE
