AIR:The sign for "air" depends on the situation. Generally I just spell it.WIND:You can use variations of the sign for "wind" to show what air is doing.  
	When you do this you generally puff out your cheeks and blow out some air.Notice, I'm not using much facial expression here, but if I wanted to show the 
	wind was blowing really hard I would use more facial expression, puff out my 
	cheeks and look like I was blowing out a birthday cake.Discussion:  "AIR"In a message dated 4/8/2007 11:20:04 PM Pacific Daylight Time, a

				teaching it to my 14 month old hearing daughter. It's been a 
				wonderful and positive experience for us! She signs about 50 
				signs now. My question: What is the sign for "air." This morning 
				she heard the heating kick in and she signed 'hot' and then blew 
				onto her hand, meaning hot air, I gather. I was a bit blown away 
				and am wondering if she indeed signed 'air' correctly? If so, 
				I'm not sure where she learned it!Very curiously yours,--Lisa POakland, CALisa,There is no widely established sign for "air."Usually we just spell it.Sometimes we sign "WIND."Often we simply show what the air is doing: filling a balloon, a tire 
		going flat, blowing trees, etc.  We use a lot of puffed-cheek 
		facial expressions and hold our hands up in loose "five" handshapes and 
		flutter them to show how the air is moving.Thus the "sign" your daughter did is really neat.  She is 
		definitely on her way to being an awesome signer.Herversionof air is going to certainly be considered one of my 
		favorites from here on out.Cordially,Dr. Bill VicarsAlso see: "airplane
