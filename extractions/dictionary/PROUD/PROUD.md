The sign for "proud or pride"Â uses a modified "A" hand. (The thumb is 
sticking out.) The hand doesn't have to make contact with the chest. It is 
okay to do the sign either way.PROUD:Memory aid: A way to remember this sign is to imagine a farmer looking over 
his crop with pride and running his thumb up one of his suspenders.Sample sentence:YOU PROUD ABOUT WHAT? (What do you take pride in?)Note: You can drop the sign "ABOUT" in the above sentence = "YOU PROUD WHAT" 
which could mean, "What are you proud of?"
