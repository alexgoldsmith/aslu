HELLO:Amy writes:I was looking thru your dictionary and couldn't find the signs for hello and 
	goodbye. I'm sure they are universal like just waving your hand or 
	something. I have been using your dictionary to teach my deaf dog signs so 
	we can communicate. I don't know what to do when I tell her goodbye so I 
	just tell her good girl then leave. Are goodbye and hello just as simple as 
	the "quiet" sign?Thanks.- AmyDear Amy,That is right. Just use the same signs that you would in the "hearing 
	world." While there is no one specific type of "wave," in general you wave 
	hello with a side to side movement. Wave good bye with a bending of the 
	large knuckles or at the wrist.- Dr. BillIn a message dated 11/6/2006 11:27:05 A.M. Pacific Standard Time,

	that might look like hey, or would that be ok?- Casandra GrahnDear Casandra,Yes, that is how you do it. Just a natural wave of the hand. The difference 
	between "hi" and "hey" is that "hi" is more of a sideways sweep and "hey" is 
	an up and down flutter.- Dr. Bill
