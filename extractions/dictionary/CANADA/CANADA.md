To do the sign for "Canada"thump (lightly) on your upper right chest area twice with the 
	palm-side of your right hand.  (Unless you are left handed, in which case the 
	location is on the left side of the chest.)CANADA:Memory aid:  The Canadian Mounted Police always get their man.  
	The sign probably originated from the idea of a Mountie grabbing somebody's shirt. 
	(Remember, you don't actually grab the shirt--just tap twice with the "A" 
	hand.)In a message dated 8/18/2005 11:23:50 AM Pacific Daylight Time,

			Canadian TV. I wouldn't label something as Signed English just 
			because it is "initialized."  Many people have that reaction,

			common ASL signs like "FAMILY," "UNCLE," and "AUNT."  If I happen to come across a

			done byDeaf CanadiansI'll post it to my website under "Canada."Cordially,Dr.

		sign for Canada.  I'm not sure what she is seeing, but the only sign 
		used for Canada is the one you have pictured, though we don't grab the 
		shirt at all.  The interpretation on CPAC is LSQ - Langue des Signes 
		Québécoise - and not ASL but, as far as I know, the sign for Canada is 
		the same.  I'm a sign language interpreter and have worked with Deaf 
		people for approximately 20 years and this is the only sign I've ever 
		seen for Canada.Thanks,SharonSharon,Thanks for the note.  Heh, you areright...in everyday 
		conversation the sign "Canada"doesn't"grab" the 
		shirt. What a fascinating example of "motherese / teacher talk" in 
		action. When teaching Hearing students, we ASL teachers often 
		over-emphasize our signs to help the students recognize the salient 
		features and or to function as a mnemonic device (memory helper) to 
		sink it in.The phrase "The Canadian Mounted Police always get their man" comes to 
		mind.  The grabbing of the shirt is iconic of the "Mountie" grabbing the 
		criminal.That is sort of like when ASL teachers show the signs Monday, Tuesday, 
		Wednesday, etc. "palm forward" to their hearing classes, but do 
		those signs 
		palm up/back when chatting with their Deaf friends.Now I'll have to put that on my to do list to go back andredo that 
		sign.Take care,Dr.
