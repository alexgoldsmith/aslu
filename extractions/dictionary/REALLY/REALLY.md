			version of the TRUE sign."NEED" is part of the "need, must, 
			have-to, should, ought-to" sign group.To express the concept of "really need":1.You could sign:"TRUE NEED"2. You could exaggerate the sign for "need" by doing it a bit larger, 
			faster, and holding it a micro-second longer at the end.The 
			sign NEED can be inflected (changed) to mean "really need" 
			by exaggerating 
			the movement of the NEED sign (without needing to add the sign "TRUE").English concepts like "really," and "very" 
			are often incorporated directly into other signs by changing (emphasizing or 
			exaggerating) the way you do the sign (not by adding a sign for 
			"really" or "very").Dr. BillSee:TRUESee:NEEDYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
