The right sign for "break" depends on what you mean.If you mean "break" as in to physically break something apart then 
			do a movement that looks as if you are snapping a small stick into 
			two pieces.BREAK / "it broke" / "It is broken."Note: You can use the above sign and then spell "UP" to mean "broke up" as in, 
"I broke up with my boyfriend (or girlfriend)."If you mean "break" as in "summer break" or a "holiday break" then use the 
VACATION sign.VACATION / "off work" / time off:If you mean break as in "intermission" or "interlude" use 
the IN-BETWEEN sign:The left hand is in a "loose" four handshape (notice in the example, my pinkie 
and ring finger are together--it doesn't matter, that's just how my hand ended 
up. The index and middle could be together too).IN-BETWEEN / insert / in the middle of / intermission:If you mean break as in PAUSE, then you can use the "PAUSE: sign:The right index finger reaches down changes to an "X" handshape and lifts up the 
left index finger.PAUSE / hold up / suspend operations:NOTES:As time goes on I'm seeing more and more people using the signs "BREAK-(apart)  
TIME" to mean, "breaktime."
I also see people signing, "I NEED BREAK" to mean, "I need a break" as in, "I 
need to rest."As a lexicographer and an ASL instructor I have mixed feelings about this.  
The ASL instructor in me wants to tell you that such usage is "wrong."The lexicographer (dictionary maker) in me wants simply to document and report 
how signs areactually being usedby Deaf (native adult) members of the 
Deaf community.Regardless, I do want you to be aware that the "correctness" of the 
			usage of the sign "BREAK-(apart)" seems to be evolving.  As more and more people start using the sign 
"BREAK-(apart)" to mean "breaktime" itmaybecome more common, thus more 
			accepted as "correct."Societymakes this decision.  Not ASL teachers. Time 
			will tell.Note: The sign for the breaking, snapping, or exploding of a 
			thing (such as a bone breaking or fireworks going off) is often 
			accompanied by a "plosive" (air rushing out such as when you voice 
			the letter "p") mouth morpheme (a movement of the mouth that conveys 
			meaning).  Such a "plosive" tends to look like you are saying "pah," 
			"pow!," "bow!," "puh!" or the first half of the word "Pop!"You can learn AmericanSign
