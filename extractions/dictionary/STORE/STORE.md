STORE: The 
		American Sign Language (ASL) sign for "store"There are different ways to sign the word "store" depending on your meaning.If you mean "store" as ina retail establishment selling items to the public you can use the sign we often 
just label as "STORE."  Perhaps a better label would be:STORE-[retail-establishment]The sign for "store" (as in a place that sells things) is made by 
	forming both hands into flattened-O shapes (as if you were holding a sheet 
	of paper) with the hands pointing downward.Pivot both of your hands forward (away from your body) twice.The fingertips swing forward and back a couple times. The thumbs are 
touching the fingers as if you were holding a piece of paper.STORE-[retail-establishment]In general the double movement makes this sign a noun.   If you 
	use a single motion, this sign means "sell."  I've noticed though, that 
	quite a few signers use the single motion to mean "store" and use the double 
	motion to mean, "selling."  This is opposite the "noun/verb pair" 
	principle.  So, even though I still teach that the "right" way to sign 
	"store" (with a double motion), I also encourage you to be flexible in the 
	"real world.""What is your favorite store?" = YOUR FAVORITE STORE, WHAT?If you mean "store" as in "storage" then use the version of "save" 
that means "to store" (as in storage).Notes:Not required reading for a basic ASL class but if you are interested in reading 
about ASL grammar then see:The myth of "STORE, I 
	GO."*
