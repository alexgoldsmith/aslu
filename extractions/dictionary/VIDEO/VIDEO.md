The sign for "video" depends on what you mean.  If you 
	mean to mean the noun video as in a movie clip then you would use the sign 
	for "MOVIE."  If you mean the verb as in "to 
	create a video" then you should use the sign "VIDEO-record."See:MOVIESee:VIDEO-GAMESee:VIDEO-PHONESee:VIDEO-RECORDSee:VIDEO-TAPESee:WEBCAMIf you want to say, "Hey let's watch a video!" - use the sign "MOVIE."MOVIE / video:This is a good general sign that shows a video camera in the action of

  "videotape," "CD," or "DVD" then go ahead and sign exactly what you 
	mean. Otherwise you should default to MOVIE.
