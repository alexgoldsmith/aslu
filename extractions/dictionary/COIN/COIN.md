If it were me, I'd just spell "coin."Sure,the "F" handshape can be used to show small round objects (like a small pole,
  buttons, orCOINS).The "F" handshape can even show movements of your eyeballs. Yes 
			indeed, that "classifier F" handshape is flexible and can show 
			pretty much any small round hole.Ahem, and therein lies the problem.  The "F" handshape could be 
			held up and the "circle" could be used to represent a single coin -- 
			but it could also be used to refer to someone's [cough] ...er...rectum 
			hole. So, you've been warned.  Make sure you establish plenty 
			of context before you go waiving around your um, hole. (So as to not 
			be misunderstood.)CL:FAlso see:COINSYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
