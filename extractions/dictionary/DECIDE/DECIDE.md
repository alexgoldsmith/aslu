Do the sign "decide" by touching the tip of your index finger to your right forehead.  
  Then change the handshape into an "F" hand as you move the hand downward. At 
  the same time as you are changing the right index finger into an "F" hand, 
  bring up your left hand into an "F" handshape.  Then when both hands are 
  at approximately lower chest level, drop them both "decisively" down a few 
  inches to a quick stop.DECIDE (full version)See
  animation:decideThere is shorter version of the sign for DECIDE.You just do the sign starting with "F" hands and bring them down 
			sharply.  This sign can also mean "to determine."DECIDE / determine (version)Notes:In a message dated 8/24/2012 8:46:41 P.M. Pacific Daylight
