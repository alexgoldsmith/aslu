  "initialized" form of "cook."  You flip a "K" over on 
	your palm as if turning a piece of food.KITCHEN (two-handed version)For an animation, see:KITCHEN (one-handed

	FAVORITE KITCHEN?Notes:Good lighting is an important part of visual gestural communication.  
	Deaf people tend to gravitate to rooms and areas where there is good 
	lighting.  Kitchens are typically well lit. When my wife and I go to a 
	restaurant we tend to look around for a table with good lighting (but where 
	there isn't a bright window directly behind one of us - since it is hard to 
	see someone's face if they are in front of a window which is streaming 
	bright light).
