The sign for "bank" is usually spelled.  Or maybe I should 
say it is "sort of" spelled. The concept of "bank" (as in "Thebankapproved my loan" is usually expressed as lexicalized fingerspelling, which is to say,
a few letters letters get a bit blended together, dropped, or only partially formed.  
Just practice spelling the word until you can do it "very" quickly.BANK:Also see: "TELLER"
