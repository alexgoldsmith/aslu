	wondering if there was a sign for the word “Ipad”. I tried searching for it 
	but was unsuccessful.Thanks,- Kathy _____, M.S., CCC/SLPKathy,There is no widely accepted sign for I-pad (yet).Most people just spell it.My younger daughter, (who due to lack of joints in her fingers doesn't 
	spell) uses a sign that mimes the use of the ipad.Another approach is to use "L" hands to show the sides and bottom of an 
	I-Pad -- but that isn't a sign for I-pad, (and shouldn't be used as such) it 
	is just adescription ofan I-Pad, used forstatements such as, "My I-pad was there on the table." Before using a 
	depictive verb (such as "L" hands showing what and I-pad looks like) you 
	generally still need to first identify the noun (the I-Pad).-- Dr. Bill
