The sign for "weak" places the fingertips of the dominant hand on 
the palm of the non-dominant hand and then bends the knuckles twice.Since I'm right handed, my left hand stays still. My right hand moves 
down, up, down.Memory Aid:
Think of being "weak in the knees."WEAK:Tip: I do NOT recommend doing this sign on yourforeheadand then 
pointing at your instructor nor your spouse.
