OPEN:Notes:ASL has a variety of very specific signs for the concept of "open" - depending on 
your exact meaning. Also it is common to mime the act of opening something 
specific.  For instance, to describe opening a can of caviar I might mime 
the act of turning the crank of  "can-opener" with my right hand while 
holding onto the can of caviar with my left hand.  Or I might mime 
placing the can into an electronic can opener and pressing the button on 
top.See:DOOR(and scroll to the "open-DOOR" section.
