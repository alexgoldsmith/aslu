Jab your non-dominant hand with the index and thumb of the dominant 
			hand as if holding a needle (or stinger). Then slap the top of your 
			hand as if squashing the little bloodsucker dead.MOSQUITO:I see this version show up from time to time.MOSQUITO: (funny / cool version)Notes:In the version above I'm holding my left fist on my nose and I'm moving 
			my dominant (right) hand --doing a twisting movement as if my nose were a drill 
  and I'm a mosquito "drilling for blood."An alternate way to do this version would be 
			to hold the non-dominant "fist" about a foot from the nose, and hold 
			the dominant hand fist between the nose and the non-dominant hand 
			and then move the dominant hand as if turning a "hand drill."Either way, ham 
			it up, have a good time. You only live once (and not for very long 
			if you are the mosquito in version 1).A 
			student raised her hand in class and asked what I meant by a "hand 
			drill." I realized that today's generation of college "kids" have 
			likely never seen an old fashioned "hand drill."In the old days people used drills that worked without electricity. 
			These were "before my time" too mind you. But I have seen one before 
			and I think they are pretty cool.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
