			more commonly: BODY "ANALYZE"Notes:Dear Dr. Bill,I work as an ophthalmic technician at Hollaway Eye Associates. I've 
			been learning ASL and hope to be certified one day. For work 
			purposes though, I was wondering what the sign for exam, as in an 
			eye exam, would be? I looked online for awhile buy I just wasn't 
			finding anything. I know you must be incredibly busy, definitely in 
			the fall season, but if you get the chance, any advice would help.
