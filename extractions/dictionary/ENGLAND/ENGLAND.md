The sign for "England" is done by placing your dominant 
			hand over your non-dominant hand. The fingers of the dominant hand 
			wrap around the pinkie side of the non-dominant hand.Note: Some people do the sign England with a single movement, but I tend to do 
  England with a double movement (as shown below) and I doEnglishwith a single movement.Note how the right hand clasps over the left, then releases and moves an inch 
  or two back up and then clasps the left hand again.The left hand stays in one place during the sign.SeeEnglishNote:There is another sign for England that uses a modified-"L-hand" 
			(with the index finger and the thumb bent). You grab the sides of 
			your chin with the index finger and thumb as if showing the 
			chin-strap of the head gear worn by the Royal Palace Guards.You can learn AmericanSign
