American Sign Language: "kiss"Many variations on this sign.  (Lots of different ways to kiss I 
reckon.)Don't worry overmuch if someone doesn't kiss the way you do.  Er...I mean, 
doesn't do the sign "KISS" the way you do.In the main version of this sign you form each hand into 
			flattened "O" handshapes and then you bring the fingertips together 
			in front of you while puckering up your lips (as if kissing 
			someone).KISS:Note: This version 
	of KISS looks a lot like the sign for MORE.  Except MORE is done a bit 
	lower and doesn't pucker up.This next version is also used by some people.KISS (version):The graphic is a bit 
			off.  Instead the thumb is wrapped in a bit more and the tip or 
			pad of the thumb is pressed to the fingers.  This version is 
			almost the same as the sign for HOME except that the KISS handshape 
			is much more flattened (but not totally flat -- it is more like an 
			extremely squished "O" hand.)  Also for the sign HOME you don't 
			pucker up. But you do pucker up for all versions of KISS.*
