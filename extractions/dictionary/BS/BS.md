Instructor told the students about two different signs with different meanings . 
So I would like to ask you a question about a certain sign " B....t" a dirty 
word. I know there are two different signs for that word. The ASL instructor 
said that if you use " \''/ " it means dirty when you use this swearing word. 
Other sign like a fist like "b to s" it means oh its ridiculous. Is that 
correct?I have lived in various states. I used different signs . For example: In 
California, some people sign " b to s" when I moved to Minnesota, they sign " 
\"/ " both signs mean the same thing.I look forward to hearing from you soon!Thanks,DianeHello Diane,Both the "horned" sign and the sign that uses the letters "B and S" are are 
swear words.And you can useeithersign as an exclamation of disgust or as a 
statement that you think something is "ridiculous."The speed, intensity, movement path, and duration of the sign--plus your facial 
expressions are what determine the intended meaning of either sign.As a hard of hearing fellow I am bilingual and am familiar with the fact that 
Hearing people say the individual letters "B" and "S" (without saying the full 
words) to mean that something is ridiculous. I recall very clearly over two 
decades ago I was hanging out with Connie Johnston (Deaf daughter of Ron 
Johnston who is also Deaf) and I signed the "B" to "S" version while voicing the 
individual letters "B" and "S." Connie was literally "shocked" that I had 
said a "swear word." Since she is d/Deaf (physically and culturally Deaf) she 
did not interpret my "sim/com" (simultaneously signed and voiced communication) 
as meaning "Oh that's ridiculous!" No. She interpreted it as meaning, "Oh that's 
b_ll sh_t!"  Note: both statements mean "that's ridiculous" -- but the 
second statement also happens to be swearing and offensive at least to some 
people.Ah ha. Lesson learned:  The English statement "BS" doesn't translate to 
EITHER of the ASL signs.The English statement "Oh BS!" (not b_ll sh_t, but rather the individual letters 
pronounced as "B" and "S") is properly expressed in ASL as the sign 
"SILLY/ridiculous" and/or the gesture/sign "Go on/get out of here" (which looks 
like a single forward to downward slap in the air).--Dr. Bill*
