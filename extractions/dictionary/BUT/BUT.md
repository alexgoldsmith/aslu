The signs "but" and "different" are basically the same sign. The sign "but" 
	generally uses a "smaller" movement, however, it may be done quite large 
	depending on how excited the signer is.  It is also very common to 
	fingerspell B-U-T when you mean "however."BUT:BUT or DIFFERENT:The sign for "but" is (in general) the same as the sign for
  "different."  However, I suggest that the sign for
  "different" uses a larger motion (in general) than the sign for
  "but."Memory aid: "A small but(t) makes 
	a big difference."  (Forgive me. Couldn't resist.)The sign below could mean either "but" or "different" depending on the rest of 
	the signs in your sentence:You can do the sign larger to incorporate the concept of "very."  When 
	doing the sign this large it is obvious that what you mean is 
	"very different" or a "large difference."very-DIFFERENT:Animations:butdifferentvery differentdifferent: other versionAlso see: The"DIFFERENT"page
