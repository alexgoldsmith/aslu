			is deaf or hard of hearing because it's generally the best way to

			for me to leave out filler words and get the grammar right. I was 
			thinking about it today and I was wondering how to sign "How was 
			your day?" After reading through someone your practise questions to 
			get a feel for the grammar, the 'translation' I came up with was 
			'YOU DAY, HOW?', signing it by pointing to the person, signing DAY 
			and then signing HOW and attempting to use proper facial expressions 
			(which is hard for me, partially because I tend to smile at the most 
			inconvenient times). I was just wondering if there was a better way 
			to sign that sentence.Thanks so much for taking the time to read my e-mail and I'd be 
			grateful for your opinion.Jenn>>Jenn,The phrase  "How was your day?" is more of a Hearing World 
			phrase than a Deaf phrase.Usually in English there is anunspokenaspect of the phrase "How 
			was your day?" For example:The word "work" as in: "How was your dayat work?"The word "school" as in "How was your dayat school?"Or some other word such as "beach" as in "How was your dayat the 
			beach?"In such situations in ASL you instead ask something to the effect 
			of:1.  WORK PROCESS GOOD?  (Did work go well?)2.  SCHOOL ALRIGHT?  (Was school alright for you? Where 
			there any problems?)3.  YOU ENJOY BEACH 
			YOU? (Did you enjoy going to the beach?)Cordially,-- Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
