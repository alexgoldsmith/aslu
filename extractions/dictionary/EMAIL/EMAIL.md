The sign for "email" has evolved a lot over the years and 
	continues to evolve.EMAIL / me-EMAIL-youIn this version of "email" the right index finger makes a pass 
	through the cavity of the left "c" hand.(The "C" hand is often modified so that the fingers are bent from the 
	knuckles and are relatively straight.")Notes:"EMAIL" is one of those signs that could easily spark an argument.I'll share my thoughts with you on the topic and you can do what you want.Some teachers might try to tell you that this sign is a noun/verb 
	pair--meaning that the single movement equals a verb and the double movement 
	equals a noun.In theory that concept makes sense and seems to be true when you do the 
	signs "in isolation" as if standing in front of a group of students and 
	showing them the sign as part of a list of signs.But in "real life" what happens is that the "1-handshape" (passing through a 
	somewhat flattened "C" handshape) version of this sign using a single movement can be interpreted 
	aseithera noun or a verbdepending on the rest of the sentence.In situations where it is important to distinguish between the noun form and 
	the verb form of "email" --use 
	a single movement as the verb form and a repeated movement is the noun form.Let me give you a comparison.  Back in the "old days" the term Google 
	was just a noun.  And then later it became both a noun and a verb. Now 
	we tend to capitalize it as a noun and lowercase it as a verb, but the same 
	"word" can be both a noun or a verb depending on the rest of the sentence.Note: the sign "EMAIL" has gone through many variations. 
	Back when email started becoming popular I noticed a bent-B-hand version 
	being used prior to the index finger version.  As time passed the index 
	finger version started showing up more than the bent-B-hand version.  
	Thus I think of the index finger version as the new form of the B-hand 
	version.The sign has also become directional. The sign "you-EMAIL-me" starts away 
	from you and moves toward you.EMAIL:EMAIL (fingerspelled version)This sign moves outward while fingerspelling.Notes:It was also quite common for people to spell E-M-A-I-L with an outward 
	movement. Notice how in my example I'm not showing the letter "A"?  
	Eventually the fingerspelling version became shortened more and more until 
	now there is a version of "me-EMAIL-you" that literally looks as if you are 
	flicking a booger at someone to say "I'll email you."  (Yes, I know, 
	that is a veryclassyway of describing it eh? That's why they pay me 
	the big bucks. ...oh wait...they don't. Oh well.)OPTIONAL READING / ARCHIVES:Sort of amusing now, but "in the old days" you might also have seen an "initialized version" based on the
  "TTY-call" sign. In this old version, the right "e" hand slides along the left index
  finger. Do NOT use this version.(NotRecommended)In a message dated 7/8/2006 3:22:33 PM Pacific Daylight Time, jhender@
