THEY:In general you point towards the various people or items that are being 
		referred to and use a small sweeping movement.
		Sometimes if the people or items are considered a single unit or group, 
		you might just point at the unit or group without using a sweeping 
		movement.Note:You might see some people doing a pointing/sweeping gesture but using a 
		"Y" handshape instead of an index finger (pointing) handshape.You might 
		also see some people spelling THY (three letters) and ending up with the 
		"Y" somewhat palm down.
