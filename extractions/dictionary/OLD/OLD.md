The sign for "old"starts as a "C" hand and turns into an "S" hand as you pull it down from 
	your chin.OLD:Here's an example of OLD being signed by my friend 
	Crystil:Note the angle of her hand as she completes the sign. Also note how the fact 
	that she has "somewhat" long fingernails also influences the sign. It is 
	still a "C" / "S" but her fingers are more loose.very-OLD:You can modify the sign OLD to mean "very" old by using a larger movement 
	with a side to side motion and more facial expression.YOU how-OLD?If someone uses a "Wh" facial 
	expression (eyebrows furrowed a bit) and signs "YOU OLD ?" They are not 
	saying, "You are old."  Rather they are asking "How old are you?"Video: To play, click the small

	discuss people's ages.* There is a lot of variety. It is important to note that if you observe 
	several different Deaf people using age-related signs you are likely to see 
	several different versions of those signs.* We have to consider that often two or more people contribute separate 
	parts of the meaningful whole.Two people discussing "age" often work together to construct "meaning." 
	(Dual Party Construction of Meaning). For example: Bob might ask Mary, "YOUR 
	SON, how-OLD?" To which Mary might reply, "THREE." The whole age concept is 
	"three years old." Bob contributed the sign "OLD" and Mary contributed the 
	sign "THREE." So you have a single “concept” being created by two people. 
	There is no need for Mary to repeat the sign “OLD” in her reply since Bob 
	already introduced that concept.* Mary is likely to simply hold up a “3” hand (palm back). Note, while 
	signing “YOUR SON” Bob’s eyebrows were up and his head tilted a bit forward. 
	While signing “OLD” Bob’s eyebrows were somewhat furrowed and his head 
	tilted back ever so slightly so as to express the concept “old” as a 
	question, “how old?” Bob didn’t need a separate sign for “HOW” since it was 
	expressed “non-manually” (without using his hands) via his eyebrows and head 
	tilt while doing the sign OLD.* Suppose Mary initiated the conversation and the concept of “age” hadn’t 
	been introduced into that conversation yet, it is likely that Mary would 
	have signed, “MY SON, old-3.” The “old-3” would have been expressed by 
	touching the index finger of a “3” handshape to the chin and then moving the 
	hand downward and outward. However, I have observed many Deaf people also 
	signing this as “OLD 3” by using two separate signs: OLD and THREE.* Classroom signing and real world signing are often very different. It is 
	fine for a teacher to tell her students that the “right way” to sign “three 
	years old” is to use the “old-3” sign which uses a single handshape and 
	numerical incorporation. But we do need to be careful to recognize that if 
	we were to go out into the real world and secretly videotape 100 Deaf people 
	doing that sign, we would very likely see a number of them using two 
	separate signs to express “OLD 3.” What is “right” and wrong in a language 
	is nothing more than what the crowd is and isn’t doing. If the crowd does it 
	long enough, the old grammarians die and new grammar texts grudgingly begin 
	to include the newer forms.* Certain variations of age-signs could be considered the product of 
	assimilation rather than being examples of intentional numerical 
	incorporation. By this I mean, since the sign “OLD” and the following number 
	sign are done so close together we may in fact simply be seeing one sign 
	assimilate characteristics of the other sign. This would be similar to the 
	way you will sometimes see the sign “I” done with a “bent hand” when signing 
	the phrase “I KNOW.” The sign “I” in that case assimilates the handshape of 
	the following sign, “KNOW.” This process could be applied to age-signs which 
	is to say a case could be made that the sign OLD is simply assimilating the 
	handshape of the sign THREE because the two signs are so close in proximity.* Not all numbers are created equally. Some numbers are more complex than 
	others. For example, certain variations of numbers (e.g. 23, 25, 35), have 
	internal movement. The more complex a number, the less likely we are to add 
	even more complexity by using numerical incorporation.* Some numbers have handshapes that are more conducive to touching the chin 
	than others. It is slightly more difficult to touch your chin with the 
	middle finger of the number “9” than it is to touch your chin with the index 
	finger of the number “8.” Those numbers which use the extended index finger 
	are more likely to be touched to the chin that other numbers which do not 
	extend the index finger.
