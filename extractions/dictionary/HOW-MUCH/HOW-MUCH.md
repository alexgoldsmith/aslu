The sign "how much" is what I call a "wh-q" sign.  That means
  since it falls into a category of questions that typically start with the letters "wh" 
	(who, what, when, where, why, etc. -- including "how" and "how much"). You should
  furrow your eyebrows a bit when asking such questions. (Unless you are asking 
	them in arhetoricalsense only.)The sign "how-much" has several variations. If you mean "How much is that?" or "How much did it cost?" a good variation 
	to use is the one-handed version that moves upward while changing a palm-up 
	"O" into a loose-5 handshape.  This is actually just a one-handed 
	version of the sign "HOW-MANY?"HOW-MUCH?Sample sentence:
	"How much should you tip a waitress?" = SERVER, YOU SHOULD TIP HOW-MUCH?If you mean "how much" as in "How much is that worth?". "What is that 
	worth?". and/or "What is the value or price of that?" a good version to do 
	is the "worth" version.Use "F" handshapes. The tips of the thumbs and index fingers on each
  hand move together and touch the tips on the other hand-twice.WORTH = "value / price / how much"Suppose you wanted to discuss "volume" or "amounts?"  As in, 
	"How much salt should I put in?" You may see some people combining 
	the sign "HOW" with the sign "A-LOT."HOW-MUCH-(volume) ("HOW" + "A-LOT" variation)But realistically you can just use the one-handed version of "HOW-MANY" to 
	mean "how much" in most situations, including, "How much salt?" or even "How-much should you tip 
	your ASL instructor?"Dr. Bill's Notes:For the answer to that "How much should you tip your ASL instructor?" 
	question, see the "a lot" page:A-LOTAlso visit online: "http://www.lifeprint.com/donate.htm"
