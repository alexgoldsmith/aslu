The sign PARTY can be done with either "Y" handshapes or with "P" 
	handshapes.A colleague emailed me to say that "PARTY" and "PLAY" are distinguished by 
	differences in the movement of the signs:PLAY:  Arms stay stationary, wrists twist.PARTY:  Wrists stay straight, arms swing back and forth.Of course, as is my way, I immediately started surveying a large number of 
	skilled signers as to how they did the sign PARTY.After quite a bit of research it seems fairly certain to me thatboththe "swinging" version and the "twisting" version are in widespread use and 
	as time goes on the versions of "PARTY" that use atwisting movementare becoming increasingly popular.An interesting note told to me by one of my interviewees, Erika Geiger 
	(d/Deaf), was that while she was a student at CSD (Fresno) her class was 
	planning an event.  During a planning meeting the students began 
	discussing having a party as part of the event.  Erika did the sign 
	"PARTY" using "P" hands and atwistingmovement.  Her teacher replied 
	that "ahem" it was going to be a "party" not a "partay!" 
	(using "P" hands and a shaking movement), (spelling intentional.)  Erika explained to me how the teacher 
	deliberately inflected an "old stuffy" sign for PARTY (a controlled, 
	somewhat slower, larger, side to side swinging movement using "P" hands) to 
	emphasize that this would be a classy "party" and not a rowdy party.PARTYVariation 1:Do a side to side swinging movement using "Y" hands.Insert graphic here:PARTYVariation 2:Do a side to side swinging movement using "P" hands.Insert graphic here:PARTYVariation 3:Do a twisting movement using "P" hands.PARTYVariation 4:Do a twisting movement using "Y" handsNote: This is the same sign as "PLAY."Optional Reading (not needed for class)In a message dated 1/18/2006 2:16:06 PM Pacific Standard Time,
