American Sign Language: 
		"enjoy"The sign for "enjoy" looks like 
you are signing "please" with both hands.  One on the
  chest, one on the belly. 
  Both hands move up and down at the same time, but when the right hand moves 
left, the left hand moves right.  When the right hand moves right, the left 
hand moves left.ENJOY / appreciate / pleasure / 
appreciateNote, during the sign for enjoy, the right hand
  is on the chest (or an inch or so out from the chest).  The left hand is on
  the belly (or an inch out from the belly).  The right hand moves in
  a clockwise circle (from the viewer's perspective).  The left hand
  simultaneously moves in a counterclockwise motion.This same sign also means "appreciate."As in "I appreciate your company" which is similar to saying "I enjoy having 
	you around."*
