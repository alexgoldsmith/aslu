	I usually spell out arthritis but I was wondering if there is a sign for it? 
	It would make explaining it much easier.Thanks for your time,-- MarieMarie,Yes, there is a common sign for arthritis. You simply shake an "A" hand a 
	couple times side to side a couple of inches.One of my students who had arthritis told me that she had her doctor write 
	out a prescription for her to learn ASL as a therapeutic approach to dealing 
	with her arthritis. By writing out a "prescription" it allowed her to deduct 
	the cost of the class as a medical expense.  (Note: Ha! Don't take that 
	aseithermedical or legal advice. I just thought it was a rather 
	clever way one person saved a bit of money come tax time.)- Dr. Bill
