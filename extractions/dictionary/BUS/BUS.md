BUS:Recommended version:  
Just spell 
B-U-S, (veryquickly).To sign "bus driver" combine the concepts B-U-S+DRIVE+PERSON-agent.BUS:Variation:Use a "bent V" and move it backward 
	twice.Memory aide: Try to imagine in the old days (and in some places still?) the 
	cord that went along the ceiling of a bus.  If you wanted to get off 
	the bus you reached up and pulled on that cord which rang a bell to alert 
	the driver that you wanted to get off the bus.Note: Some people in the Sacramento, California area use this sign or a "one 
	fingered" version of this sign to mean "light rail."Sign: BUS-(driving) [VERB form]The verb "bus" is done by miming the driving of a bus.  Hold on to a very big 
	steering wheel, puff your cheeks out slightly, and turn the wheel back and 
	forth a couple times.  This version tends to show up in stories after 
	you have identified the bus and are indicating how the bus is being driven.A student (pdunn718) writes:Professor,Hope all is well!A quick question if you have time...in NYC I've seen "bus" signed with 
		two "B" hands, hitting one on top of the other. vertically.. in other 
		words, not clapping palm-to-palm or palm-to-front-of-hand, but so that 
		the index finger of the bottom B hits against the pinky of the top B.Ever seen this before? Is this an ESL sign?Thanks!Dear Pdunn,Your "two B hands" version is indeed an example of "Signed English."It is quite to see various versions of vehicles done by using the initial of 
	the English word as the handshapes for the sign. While I think it is good to 
	recognize those versions when you see them, I don't recommend you do those 
	versions on an ASL test.Cordially,Dr. BillAlso see:CARAlso see:TRUCK
