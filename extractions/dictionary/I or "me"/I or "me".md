				English letter "i" is something that people do when they are 
				using what is called "Signed English." If your goal is to learnAmerican Sign Languagefor purposes of satisfying high 
				school or college 2nd language requirements then it would be 
				better for you to avoid over-initializing your signs and instead 
				stick with the versions of signs that are used by 
				multi-generational native ASL Deaf adults who have attended a 
				state residential school for the Deaf and are active in the Deaf 
				community.Also, the concept of "I" or "me" can be expressed in ways other 
				than by using a specific sign. For example, you could use move 
				the sign "GIVE" from the other person toward yourself to mean 
				"give it to me." This might be glossed (which means "written") 
				as you-GIVE-me. In that example you wouldn't use the sign "I/me" 
				-- instead you would just rely on the starting position, the 
				direction of the movement, and the ending position of the sign 
				GIVE.Cordially,Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
