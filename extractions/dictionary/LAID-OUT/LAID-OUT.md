This sign can mean "to be so sick as to be laid up in bed." I'm using a 
pained expression to it is assumed that I'm injured or sick. If I used a 
"tired" expression, this sign could mean I'm so exhausted or tired as to be 
physically wasted and had to be in bed to recuperate.LAID-OUT sick. (Really ill / bedridden / wasted)
