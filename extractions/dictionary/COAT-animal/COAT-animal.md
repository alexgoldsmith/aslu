American Sign Language:  
		"Coat: "Animal Coat"In ASL you express 
            the concept of animal's coat differently than you would a human's 
            coat.The sign for 
            "animal coat" would be:1. Establish the context that you are talking about animals.2. Consider the size of the animal.3. If the animal is small you can use your non-dominant fist as a 
            classifier to represent the animal's body. (We are not talking about 
            animal placement nor movement, thus we are not using a "bent-V" 
            classifier.)4. If the animal is large you can use your non-dominant arm to 
            represent the body.5. If the animal is a primate or walks upright you can sometimes use 
            your chest and torso to represent the body.6. If the animal is "very large" like a horse or moose you could 
            place your non-dominant hand on an imagined animal and run your 
            dominant hand along the imagined animals body.7. Once you have established the body, you can spell "fur" and then 
            use a slightly curved "5" handshape to indicate where the fur is by 
            moving the "5-hand" along the body surface. (From the hand to the 
            wrist, up the arm, down the torso, or along whatever body surface 
            area you have established in the preceding steps.)*
