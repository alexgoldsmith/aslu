Thesign for gold starts with a loose index-finger handshape pointing at 
			the earlobe and then you shake a "Y" handshape.But this is a
  "flexible" sign.  While most people use an index-finger or "L" 
			hand as the first
  handshape in the sign for California; some people use a "five
  handshape."CALIFORNIA:I tend to just sign "gold" using
  the index finger and "y" handshape to mean, "California."CALIFORNIA:In everyday usage the sign CALIFORNIA "actually" starts with 
			somewhat of a loose "L" hand (rather than a "tight" "index hand").  
			Quite often it starts with an "ILY" (I love you) handshape!Memory aid: California is theGoldenState.The non-initialized sign forGOLD(the version 
			that uses a "Y" hand) is the basis of the sign for California.You will also see quite a few people starting the sign for 
			California with a "5" handshape rather than an "1" or "L" handshape.CALIFORNIA (version)You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
