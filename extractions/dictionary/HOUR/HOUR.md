	handed:The right hand is the "minute" hand.The left hand is the face of the clock.HOUR:Sample sentence: "How many hours 
	equals one day?"Here is another version of hour.  I don't do this version much because 
	I don't need the stress on my joints and I'm not a fan of "carpal tunnel 
	syndrome."HOUR (twisting wrist version)The sign "HOUR" can make use of "numerical
  incorporation."  To sign "2 hours" you can "incorporate" the 
	"two" handshape into the sign for "hour."TWO HOURS:You can express the concept of a 
"half hour" by showing the minute hand having moved "half way" (or 30 
minutes) around 
the face of a clock.HALF-HOUR (version 1):HALF-HOUR (version 2):See:HALF-HOURNotes:You can incorporate the number of 
	hours into the sign for hour when discussing hours 1 through 9. More than 10
