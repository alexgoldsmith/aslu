American Sign Language: "beef"BEEF:Just fingerspell the word: B-E-E-F.Also see:MEATAlso see:COWDr. Bill's notes:During a discussion on a Facebook page a person mentioned that to express the 
concept of "beef" he/she signed a combination of "COW" + "MEAT."For what it is worth, I recommend spelling "BEEF" -- then if someone asks you 
what "beef" means go ahead and sign "COW MEAT."The person on the Facebook page is married to a supportive, yetHearingspouse who likely reads fingerspelling rather slowly at this point in his/her 
development. Thus you can see why the person's signing choices are geared toward 
signing "COW" and "MEAT" -- even thoughit is much fasterto spell 
"B-E-E-F" than to do the signs "COW" and "MEAT."BEEF is typicallyspelledby adult native Deaf signers when communicating 
with each other (here in the United States) because it is faster to spell those 
four letters than to do two separate signs.If you go to a Deaf event and sign "COW MEAT" -- adult native Deaf signers will 
assume you are "Adult Late Deafened" or a "student."*
