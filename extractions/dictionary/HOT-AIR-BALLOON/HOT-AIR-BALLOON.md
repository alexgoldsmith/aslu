Hi Dr. Bill,I am a writer and I am currently working on a book about teaching 
			sign language to hearing babies. I realized that in all of the 
			classes I have taken on the subject and in all of the research I 
			have done, I have not come across a sign for "hot air balloon." Is 
			there such a sign? If so, could you possibly explain its formation 
			to me? I greatly appreciate your help with this matter!Sincerely,Teresa R. SimpsonMemphis, TN
