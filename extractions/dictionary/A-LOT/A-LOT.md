The sign for "a lot" is a variation 
of the sign "big" except that the hands on "a lot" are "loose 5 handshapes" and 
are pointed a bit more upward.A-LOT:This sign can be used to mean "much" or to indicate a large amount of
  something "uncountable" (such as "a lot of water.")Suppose you wanted to say, "Awholebunch!"Â  You can modify the 
sign "a lot" by adding more facial expression (check out the wild and crazy eyes 
eh?) and a bit of a hold just after you start the sign and then use a fast 
strong finish:Also see:MUCH
