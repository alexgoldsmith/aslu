There are several versions of this sign.They are all out there being used by various people.I use the 
  first one because it is more popular where I live, but I think the second version 
	makes more "sense."MAN:  (Version A)The first part of this sign is similar to the sign "father" and then moves 
	down to touch the chest.(p.s. If you start this sign at the chin and move it down to the chest 
	it means "woman.")(p.p.s. No, I don't know where you can buy acoolsweater like the one 
	I'm wearing here.)(p.p.p.s. No, it doesn't matter how much you offer me, I won't sell you mine. 
	It was a gift.)MAN:  (Version B)MAN:  (Version C)Note: this version isn't used much.
 This third version could be used to indicate that someone 
  is no longer a child but is a man (male + adult).Also see:BOYAlso see:GIRLAlso see:Boy & GirlYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
