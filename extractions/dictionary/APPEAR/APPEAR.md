The right sign for "appear" 
depends on your meaning.If you mean appear as in "show up" there is a specific sign for "showing up."SHOW-UP or "pop-up"Also see:SHOW-UPNote: I've seen some ASL teachers use the "pop up" sign (above) as part of the 
concept of a "pop quiz."Â  I don't have a problem with that but personally I 
prefer to signSURPRISEQ-U-I-Z insteadIf you mean "appear" as in "it appears that..." then you should use the 
	"SEEM" sign.SEEM:Also see:SEEMIf you mean "appear" as in "looks" or a person's appearance, you should use the
