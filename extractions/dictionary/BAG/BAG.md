BAG:Most of the time the concept of "bag" is going 
			to just be spelled: "B-A-G." Spelling "bag" is actually faster than 
			doing a sign for it.At high speed the "A" gets morphed a bit and the spelling just looks 
			like a "sign."Did you pay attention to what I just said?Do you think I type this stuff out because I like typing?I told you tospellthe concept of "bag" = B-A-G.Some of you areafraidof fingerspelling and are going to bestubbornand want a "sign" for bag.Fine. If you feel like looking silly here it is:BAG:Now don't show up in your 
			local ASL class or at a Deaf event and say, Dr. Bill says this is 
			the sign for "bag."Nope. I didn't tell you to sign that.  I told you to spell it.Also see:SUITCASEAlso see:PURSEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
