			notice that over time this sign has evolved.  It seems most 
			people are now doing the sign starting with an "S" handshape (or a "closed O" handshape).POETRY (slightly out of date version)  (Should now start with

	The idea is to take the beauty in your heart and offer it up to the world.Animation:Poetry ("from the heart" version)POETRY (Very old initialized version of

  dominant hand.  That changes the meaning to "poetry" instead of music. 
	The initialized version is considered by many to be "signed English."You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
