	writes:I found your website and have been using it as a reference to teach my 
	infant daughter sign language. So far it's been a success! However, I cannot 
	find a reference on how to sign the word "tickle". I have not beenable to find it on your site or on other internet sites. Can you please 
	help? My daughter loves to be tickled and I want to show her how to ask me 
	to tickle her. She only knows to sign "more" after I already tickle her.Thank you so much for your time! Any help or suggestion would be muchappreciated!B.H.-------------B.H.,There is no widely established sign for "tickle."  You will 
			see a few "made up" signs in various baby sign "dictionaries."Two signs I'd be willing to support are:1.Holding both hands out in front of you and wiggling your curved 
			fingers as if tickling someone's ribs while smiling mischievously.2.Bending and unbending an index finger near the armpit.Cordially,Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
