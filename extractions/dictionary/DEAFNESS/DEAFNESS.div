     Recommendation:

     <br/>
     Avoid signing the concept at all.
     <br/>
     Instead adjust your sentence or discussion to be about
     <b>
      Deaf

     people rather 
than a medical condition.

       If you "must" for some reason sign the concept of "deafness" here 
are a few ways to go about it:
       <br/>
       <p>
        <p>
         Version 1:
         <b>
          [context]
         </b>
         + the sign
         <a href="deaf.htm">
          DEAF
         </a>
         <br/>

         <p>
          <p>
           <p>
            Version 2:
            <br/>
            Fingerspell it:

            <p>
             <p>
              <br/>
              Version 3:
              <br/>
              Sign DEAF and spell N-E-S-S
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <hr/>
              <p>
               <font color="#FF0000">

                 Warning to

               Some of you are or will become interpreters for the Deaf.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               As such if you become a working interpreter for the Deaf and go out into the 
Deaf World you will very likely eventually see someone use the Signed English 
sign for "deafness."  I'm assuming here you would rather recognize it than 
have to interrupt and ask what it means.
               <br/>
               Such being the case I'm going to show you the Signed English version of the 
sign.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Some of you are going to be an "idiot" and run to your ASL instructor or Deaf 
friend and say that "Dr. Bill" of ASLU / Lifeprint says the sign for "deafness" 
is [__________]" and then you will show them the following sign without context 
or explaining that the only reason I'm showing you is so that you can add it to 
your receptive vocabulary.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Since the above notice is too complex for some of you I'm going to put this 
clearly:
               <br/>
               I'm showing you the Signed English version of the sign so you will RECOGNIZE it 
--
               <b>
                <font size="5">
                 NOT
                </font>
               </b>
               so you will start signing it.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Understand it if you see it -- but don't sign it.
               <br/>
              </p>
              The "Signed English" version of the sign for "deafness" is a combination of the ASL sign DEAF and 
			the Signed English suffix sign "-NESS."  The sign DEAF touches 
			the index finger to the cheek near the ear. Then the finger lifts 
			off of the cheek a bit and moves in a small arc and touches the 
			cheek again near the mouth. Then you hold the side of an "N" hand 
			onto the upper palm of the non-dominant flat hand (of which the palm 
			is forward and the fingertips are up) and slide the N-hand downward 
			toward the heel of the non-dominant flat hand. This sign is 
			generally considered Signed English.

                 Notes:
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Most "culturally Deaf" leaders 
			and authors have negative views regarding the use of the word 
			"deafness."
                 <br/>
                 Most of us prefer to simply avoid the phrase and use some other way to discuss 
the state of being deaf.
                 <br/>
                 Some examples:
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 "... Deaf..."
                 <br/>
                 "... people who are Deaf,"
                 <br/>
                 "... Deaf and hard of hearing people..."
                 <br/>
                 "... since becoming deaf she..."
                 <br/>
                 "... being deaf..."
                 <br/>
                 "... her being deaf did not prevent..."
                 <br/>
                 "... the fact that she is deaf had little bearing on..."
                 <br/>
                 <br/>
                 Some authors use the phrases "... not hearing..." or "individuals with hearing loss."  
While that is better than the (unacceptable) term "hearing impaired" 
it focuses on loss rather than gain.  Instead it is recommended that you 
simply use the term "Deaf" or if you you have some strong reason to indicate the 
state of being physically deaf (such as writing a dissertation comparing the 
outcomes of children born deaf into (culturally) Deaf and Hearing households) 
then use the lowercase term "deaf." Be advised though that there are those who 
feel that the word "Deaf" should always be capitalized.  A dictionary entry 
is not the place to deep dive into a topic deserving of a nuanced chapter in a 
book.  Such being the case, readers are encouraged to go read several "Deaf 
Culture" books or view numerous vlogs (preferably written or signed by 
culturally Deaf individuals).
