There is indeed a sign for the concept of "VERY."  It looks like the sign 
	"BIG" but is done with "V" handshapes.I suggest however that younotuse the "VERY" sign and instead focus oninflectingyour signs to 
	include themeaningof "very" into your existing 
	sign or set of signs.For example, suppose our mutual friend got sunburned badly and I wanted to tell 
	you about it, I might wish to express the concept:"His face wasveryred."In that sentence the word "very" is an adverb.  The word "red" is an 
	adjective.In ASL I'd use the signs:  "HIS FACE RED."  To indicate the 
	concept of "veryred" I would "inflect" (change the way I signed) the 
	concept "red" in the following ways:1.  I'd use an intense facial expression2.  I'd hold the initial handshape in starting location for a fraction 
	of an instant longer before starting the movement.3.  I'd do a larger downward movement.4. I'd hold the ending handshape in the ending location for a fraction of an 
	instant longer than normal.5. At the beginning of the sign I'd tilt my head back slightly and then as I 
	did the sign I'd nod my head using a single, short, quick movement.6. My elbow would stick slightly farther out to the side at the beginning of 
	the sign and bring the elbow down sharply during the sign.Those six modifications (inflections) to the sign "RED" would change the 
	sign to mean "very-RED."Those six modifications actually created the adverb "very."Most verbs and many other signs can be inflected in such a way as to 
	eliminate for need for a separate sign for "very."Notes:QUESTION:An ASL Instructor (Deaf/over 30 years teaching experience) writes:"I have a question about expressing the concept of 'very'. . .Is it also correct, in certain situations, to convey the concept of 
			'very' by using the sign for: really; truly (as signed with a 
			dominant index finger held in front of the nose; palm faces the 
			non-dominant side of body and finger points up; move hand in one, 
			small upward-forward arc)?For example, to express that someone is 'very polite,' would it be 
			correct to sign: truly, polite?In almost all instances I use the methods you described on your 
			'very' page but I do occasionally use the 'truly/really' sign as 
			well. Or I use it in conjunction with the methods you described."--------------------RESPONSE:Dear _____ (Name removed to protect the person's privacy.)Hello.Yes, certainly, the sign for TRUE is often used to express the 
			concept of "very" in ASL.Another sign in this category is the TERRIBLE/awful/awesome sign.  
			It is sometimes used to mean "extremely" or "exceedingly."  As in 
			"MOVIE TERRIBLE-[extremely] GOOD!"Also the "too-MUCH" sign (the one that uses bent hands and can 
			mean "over" or "more than") can mean "very" in situations where 
			English might use "overly."Depending on context, the CHAMP sign can mean "very."Any other similar signs dome to mind?- Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
