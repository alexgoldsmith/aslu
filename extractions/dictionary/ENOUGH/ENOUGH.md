    hand palm down and moved from mid-abdomen to chin? Or are they different 
    kinds of full? Or, is it an "Indiana" thing?Response:No.  These are two different concepts:  FULL-(general) and "full"-(of 
  food, "had it up to here) are not interchangeable."Full"-(of food, "had it up to here") is only used for concepts like "I can't 
  eat any more" or "I've had it up to here with you!"-(requires proper facial
