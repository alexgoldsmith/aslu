PANCAKE:Memory aid: 
This sign is looks like you are flipping a pancake.PANCAKE: (variation)Note:  There is an initialized version of this sign that uses the tip of
the middle finger of the right "p" hand to draw a pancake sized
circle about a half an inch above the surface of the left flat hand. 
(I recommend you stick with the pancake flipping version above.)
