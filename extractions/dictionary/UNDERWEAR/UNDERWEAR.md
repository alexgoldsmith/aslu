The sign for "underwear"is made by using the index finger and thumb of
        each hand to trace the outline of your underwear.  Your palms face backward. 
        Your hand shape changes from an upside down "L" to a closed
        "G."UNDERWEAR:STUDENT:  I've seen some other sign for underwear up near the 
	mouth? Is that an okay sign?Dr. Bill:  Hey, I've seen that sign too. A bunch of my older friends 
	sign it that way.  It looks sort of like a loose "C" hand that closes a 
	couple of times into an "S" hand at the chin.I've never particularly liked that version, (to me doing the sign near the 
	mouth makes me think of the phrase "eat my shorts" -- which I've never done mind you) but I've noticed people get rather protective oftheirunderwear so 
	ifthat is how most Deaf people do itin your area, by all 
	means when in Rome do as the Romans do!  If they want to eat their 
	shorts, wear togas, and party all night long, then you have acultural 
	responsibilityto join in.Underwear isn't just for the bottom half (unless perhaps you are inFrance), so for all yougalsout there we need a sign for the top. I prefer 
	to go with a classic beige underwire modified "L" handshape showing the 
	general area covered by a bra.BRA or bikini:p.s. To "Jack" in SF, "No, I willnotmodel this further. But thanks for askingthoughand best wishes  
	for a delightful summer."Notes:A student asks: "If you are sitting, how would you sign things like 
	pants and underwear above that region of the body?"Dr. Bill answers: Just do such signs a little higher than normal.
