To sign "fancy,"
you brush the tip of the thumb of your right five-hand twice on your chest using
an upward motion.  The hand moves in a large circle, up, out, down, back.  
  It is on the upward stroke that the thumb-tip touches the chest.  The 
  sign "polite" uses a smaller movement.  The sign fancy uses a larger 
  movement.FANCY:Also see:FINEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
