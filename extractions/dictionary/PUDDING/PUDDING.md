There is no one specific widely recognized sign for pudding.  
			Of course, some people just spell it.Others 
			however spell it and then sign "SOUP" (because the sign for "soup" 
			is represented by eating from a bowl with a spoon).  Still 
			others upon first reference will spell PUDDING and then sign 
			SWEET-SOUP.  Then for the rest of the conversation will simply 
			sign "SOUP" or "SWEET" but not both.  I personally only talk 
			about pudding about once every few years but when I do I spell 
			"pudding" if I'm chatting with an adult and I do the "SWEET SOUP" 
			version if I'm chatting with a small child.PUDDING = SWEET + SOUP:Notes:In a message dated 1/26/2006 9:11:30 AM Pacific Standard Time, ebergstr@_____.net
