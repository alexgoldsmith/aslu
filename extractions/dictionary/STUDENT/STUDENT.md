The sign for "student" is a combination of the sign "learn" and 
	the non-initialized sign for "person."  


	Hold your "non-dominant") hand out flat, palm facing upward.  Take 
	your dominant hand and and grab some 
  imaginary information off of your palm.  Lift that 
  information up and stick it in your head.  Then show theperson sign.The more "casually" you do the sign STUDENT, the more the sign looks 
	as if you are throwing away a piece of paper.Note: When signing "STUDENT" your non-dominant hand should stay down near 
	your torso andnotmove up toward your head when you move the 
	dominant hand upward. We want to avoid looking as if we are combining the 
	signs STUDENT andTEACHER.STUDENT (casual version):STUDENT: longer more formal version:STUDENT (or "Learner"  =  "LEARN
