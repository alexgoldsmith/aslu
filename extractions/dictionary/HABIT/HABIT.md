The sign for "habit" sort of reminds me of the 
	idea of being "chained" or "bound" to a particular activity.This sign can mean "accustomed to" or "used to." The sign moves straight down.HABIT:Memory 
	hint:
  The activities you are "handcuffed to."Sample sentence: "Do you have any habits?" = HABIT ANY YOU?There is a version of this sign that I label as "ACCUSTOMED- to." It 
	starts with an open dominant hand which changes into a "closed" hand.  
	Lots of people use this sign to mean "habit."HABIT / accustomed-to:Note:You may see this sign done with a"T" on the dominant hand, if so, it means: "tradition."
