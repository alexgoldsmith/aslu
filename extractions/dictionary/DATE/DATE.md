This version of the sign is good if you mean "date" as in the concept of two 
people getting together to develop their relationship as in, "Do you want to go 
on a date?" 
Start with your hands slightly apart,palms facing each other, handsin "D" shapes.  Bring the hands 
together to touch at the fingertips, then pull apart about an inch-and-a-half 
then bring together again.  Use a small quick movement.DATE:If you mean "date" as in a specific day that something will happen, 
			then either spell the letters D-A-T-E, or construct your sentence to 
			not need the word "date." For example, "YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY, [what] 
			DAY?" [Raise your eyebrows a bit on the signs YOUR and BIRTHDAY, 
			then furrow your eyebrows a bit on the sign DAY.]See:DAYSee:BIRTHDAYIn a message dated 1/31/2014 10:57:22 A.M. Pacific Standard Time,
