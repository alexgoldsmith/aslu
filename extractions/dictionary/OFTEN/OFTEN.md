American Sign Language: 
		"often"OFTEN:The tips of the bent right "b" hand touch the palm of the left hand
  (near the heel of the palm) then separate and move forward a couple inches,
  then make contact again.  If you do this sign quickly, and add another
  movement it would mean "frequently."LIBRARY, YOU GO HOW OFTEN?FREQUENTLY:The sign for "frequently" can be done the same as the sign for "often." 
	However, some people also add an extra movement and contact. Remember, the contacts move from the palm of the hand (somewhat near the
  heel) toward the fingertips of the hand.*
