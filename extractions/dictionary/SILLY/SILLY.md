The sign for "silly" wiggles a "Y" hand in front of your face.The 
movement is a double twist. Sort of like the "hang loose" gesture or the 
sign for YELLOW (but done in front of the face).SILLY:Memory Aid: "Homer Simpson has a silly yellow face."You can modify the sign "SILLY" to mean, "that's ridiculous" or "he is a
fool." The modified version uses a single large sweeping motion with a 
bit of a twist in the wrist.SILLY / foolish / ridiculous:Sample sentence:
YOU THINK HE/SHE TEACHER SILLY? (Do you think the teacher is silly?)Also see:DUMBAlso see:STUPID
