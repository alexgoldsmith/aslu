CONVINCE:From: "Antonio Heckstall"Hello!My name is Antonio and I am 14. I am hard-of-hearing. I frequently use your 
website as a resource for my ASL. I want to know what are the variations for the 
sign "convince"? I know about the two hands in the B handshape, but what about 
the one (or two) with the non dominant hand in a 1 handshape and the dominant in 
a B? Are there 2 ways for this (one with the B doing a wavy motion behind the 1 
and the other doing a chopping motion on the 1 handshape). Can you help me ASAP 
because I don't want to continually do the wrong sign :).Thanks!- AntonioDear Antonio,Yes, there are a couple of variations of the sign "convince." Both the "two 
handed chop" version and the "one-handed"chopping of the index finger version" 
are good and well-accepted signs.  I'm not sure what you are referring to 
regarding a "wavy" movement.  Perhaps you are referring to the sign 
"butter-up" which in some ways means persuade and to some extent can mean 
"convince."Cordially,Dr. BillCONVINCE (2-handed "chop" version)CONVINCE (1-handed "chop" version)PERSUADE-(butter_up)
