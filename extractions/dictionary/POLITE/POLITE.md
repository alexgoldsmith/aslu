American Sign Language: "polite"To sign polite you brush the tip of the thumb
  of your dominant five-hand twice on your chest using an upward motion.  The
  hand moves in a very small circle, up, out, down, back.  It is on the
  upward stroke that the thumb-tip touches the chest.  You might see other
  versions of the sign "polite," but this is how I do it.POLITE:*
