I kid you not -- there are over adozenways to sign birthday.  
			Your best bet is to interact with plenty of native Deaf adults in 
			your local region and see which versiontheyare signing.Until you discover which version of birthday is most popular in your 
			area (there might be several versions used in the same region) a 
			fairly safe way is to just combine the signs "BIRTH" and "DAY." 
			If and when you get "corrected" just smile and thank them for 
			letting you know.But hey, since you askedme, I'll show you how I sign "birthday."  
	I touch the tip of my middle finger to my chin, then I touch it to
  my heart.BIRTHDAY:NOTES:People who are left hand dominant ("lefties") can do a mirror image. 
			They don't have to end "over the heart." They can end on the other 
			side of the chest.As a student or newbie you should NOT argue with your local Deaf 
			regarding how to do this sign. And certainly don't argue with your 
			local ASL instructor (unless you want a bad grade eh?).  Just 
			be flexible and "When in Rome do as the Romans do."The generic version of "birthday" is to just combine one of the 
			versions of "BIRTH" with one of the versions of "DAY."BIRTHDAY: BIRTH + DAY:Also see:BIRTHAlso see:DAYYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
