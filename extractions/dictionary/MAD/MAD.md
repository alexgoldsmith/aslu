The sign for "mad"(as in the opposite of 
	happy) uses a single motion. If you use a double motion and a slightly less 
	intense face it can mean, "grouchy" or "grumpy."Don'tactually touch your face while doing this sign.  (That might be painful, and 
	then you'd bereally"mad" at me.)MAD:Memory aid:Think of the way a person's face gets all scrunched up when he or she is
  mad.Sample sentence:  "Why are you mad?" =  "YOU MAD what-FOR?"STUDENT:  Is the sign 
	"MAD" considered to be 
  generally less intense than the sign for "Angry"?Dr. Bill:  I think of mad as being less intense than 
	"angry," yes.  
  But, I it depends on the usage (body language and facial expression).  A person can sign the word "MAD" 
  with very strong facial expression and it can actually bemore intensethan a 
  typical version of ANGRY.  But I think if you were to work at it, 
  ANGRY could adopt a more intense facial expression and body posture 
  than "MAD."Also see:ANGRYAlso see: "Angry/Mad advanced
