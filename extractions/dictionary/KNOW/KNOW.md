The sign for "know" touches the side of your forehead with 
	the tips of the fingers of your hand in a flat shape.KNOW:Sample sentence:  Do you know the teacher's wife's name?It is very common for the sign for "KNOW" to be done on the cheek. 
	Some people call it
  "lazy" signing.
	I think a better word for it would be casual signing.  Or perhaps evenefficientsigning. It is a perfectly fine way to sign the concept.KNOW: (casual version)If you want to sign, "knowledge," "familiar," or "I'm aware of that" you use 
	a double movement. Touch the forehead (or cheek) twice.  See:FAMILIARFAMILIAR-with:To sign "know that" you use a very quick downward movement and change the 
	handshape into a rather loose "Y" (or even a "flat-hand").KNOW-THATThe sign "don't know" uses a movement similar to "know that." The difference
  is that DON'T KNOW keeps the "B" (or "flat") handshape and tends to raise the
  shoulders and use a head shake.
	Here I'm showing a "casual" version of the sign.  Note how it starts on 
	or near the cheek (instead of the forehead) and twists forward.DON'T KNOW:If you have Windows media player, you might be able to view this .wmv file:DON'T KNOW
