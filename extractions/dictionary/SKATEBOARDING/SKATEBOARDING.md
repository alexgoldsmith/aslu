Here is a good general sign for "skateboard."It is based on the concept of four wheels.The upside down bent "V" handshapes represent two-wheels each.You do a double forward movement. (You move forward about 10 
			centimeters, back 8 centimeters, and forward 10 centimeters).SKATEBOARD (or "skateboarding")Animation: "skateboard"Notes:There are other signs for "skateboarding" out there.For example, one version uses the non-dominant palm-down flat-hand 
			to represent the skateboard and puts the index finger of your 
			dominant upside-down "V" hand on the "skateboard" to represent a 
			person "on the skate board." Then you move the middle finger as if 
			it were a leg and foot "pushing" your skateboard forward. It is a 
			pretty clever little sign but doesn't feel quite as natural as the 
			version above.See:ICE-SKATESee: "SKATING"See: "SNOWBOARDING"You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
