The sign for "hockey" uses an "X" handshape to 
			represent a hockey stick.
  Imagine you have a pea sized hockey puck on your left palm and your right hand 
			(if you are right-handed) 
  bent index finger is a hockey stick. Use the "hockey stick" to knock the puck 
  backward twice.HOCKEY:You can learn AmericanSign
