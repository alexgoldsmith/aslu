			fractions?-Robyn PenceRobyn,I see decimals being used in ASL the same as they are used in spoken 
		languages.So if I were you I wouldn't covert all decimals into fractions just so 
		you can sign them as fractions.  If you are talking about data that 
		involves decimals then use your index finger to poke a "dot" in the air 
		as if making a decimal. Some people make decimals with a straight index 
		finger. Some people poke the air using their thumb and index finger (as 
		if holding a needle and popping a balloon).Bill*
