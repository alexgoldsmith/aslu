The way to sign "shirt" is by grabbing
your shirt in the upper chest area - in the middle or slightly to the right
- between your index finger and thumb.  Then tug outward a few times. The sign for shirt can be done with one hand or two. If you do it with one 
hand though it might sometimes be misunderstood to mean "volunteer."SHIRT / volunteer / applyRemember:  This is also the sign for "volunteer, apply, pick me, candidate" and
related signs.If you need to distinguish between the sign for volunteer and shirt, I
recommend signing "shirt" with two hands.SHIRT (2 handed variation)SHIRT (blouse variation)I personally tend to use this version to mean "BLOUSE" 
	but lots of people use it as their regular sign for shirt.
