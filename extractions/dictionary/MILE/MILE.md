American Sign Language: 
		"mile"MILES:MILE (odometer version):Miles = M-I-L-EExample: "100 miles" = "100 M-I-L-E" or "100 M-I-L-E-S."Note: While we almost never see "inches" spelled with the "es," we do often see 
the "s" used with "miles."Note: I've seen a number of people (mostly young) use the sign "ODOMETER" 
(right index finger circling left index finger) to mean "miles."Related concepts:Inches = I-N-C-HExample:  "15 inches" = "15 I-N-C-H" (We drop the "es." The number 15 causes the 
"INCH" to be plural without adding the "es."Gallon = GALExample:  "12 gallons" = "12 G-A-L"*
