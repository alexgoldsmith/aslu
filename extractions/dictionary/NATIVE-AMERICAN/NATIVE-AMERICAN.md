American Sign Language:

version / Native 
American Sign Language (NOT ASL)Use a double movement (see notes).Notes: While conversing in my office with a transfer student (who was Deaf and a 
skilled ASL user), I noticed that she did the sign "SURFACE" when referring to 
"Native Americans" or what was formerly referred to as "American Indians." I 
asked where she got that sign and she indicated that she learned it from a 
faculty member at a large university in the Northridge California area.  
This doesn't mean that the sign is being taught as ASL at that university, it 
simply means that one person showed it to another person and it is being used in 
some conversations between some people.  The reason why I'm including it 
here is because I became curious about the sign and I went to an old "Indian 
Sign Language" dictionary and looked up their sign for "Indian." The original 
movement of sign for Native American in the "Indian Sign Language" dictionary 
was not similar to the  ASL sign SURFACE, rather the movement was closer to 
the ASL sign "PET" but with a reversed movement - making two forward strokes 
(not circular movements as in the sign SURFACE).It appears that some second language users of the sign have mutated the sign 
into using a circular movement of the dominant hand.  I will be watching to 
see if others adopt either of these versions to replace the existing ASL sign.  
The sign is likely to meet with resistance due to looking too much like the 
existing ASL signs for "SURFACE" and "PET."Interestingly enough, it is reasonable to state that this is a sign "some" 
Native Americans use or have used to describe themselves via at least one 
version of "Indian Sign Language" and at least one published source mentions 
that this sign is associated with the color of the skin of Native Americans.*
