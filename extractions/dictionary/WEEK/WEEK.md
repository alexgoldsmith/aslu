The sign for "week" has a couple of variations. The basicsign for "week" is
made by forming your dominant hand into an index-finger handshape and moving 
	your hand forward over the palm of your non-dominant hand.WEEK:"One week has how many days?"Variation:The sign WEEK can also be done with the left
hand (or non-dominant hand) in an "index finger" handshape, palm facing right.  The
right hand slides outward over the top/side of the left hand and index finger. 
If you are holding a drink or a sandwich in your left hand you can even do this sign without
the left hand! (Like most signs actually).
