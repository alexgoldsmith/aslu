			... and now find myself in the position of working with a Deaf 
			couple, with no interpreter. Obviously this is not an ideal 
			situation, but lack of finances and such make it the best we can do 
			right now...One concept I have not been able to find a sign for is 
			the idea of "coping with" or "dealing with" an emotion or problem. 
			We therapists talk a lot about coping skills, but I'm not sure how 
			to sign about them! Any ideas? I'd love to be able to ask something 
			like "You got really angry - and then how did you cope with that?"Thanks for any thoughts you might have...- Jessica E____Dear Jessica,Hello :)The ways to interpret "cope" or "deal with" are generally as 
			follows:1.PATIENCE:  Use the 
			sign for "patience."  You could sign. YOU PATIENCE THAT HOW?2.CONTROL:  The sign for 
			"control" has many meanings, including: "manage, administer, reign, 
			and handle."  The sign for "control" could be used in many 
			situations similar to the English phrase, "How did you handle that?"  
			You could sign, "YOU CONTROL THAT HOW?"3.what-DO:  The "what-DO" 
			sign can be combined with the YOU sign to mean, "What did you do?"- Cordially,Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
