The sign for "regular" looks a lot like the sign for "right."  The
difference is that for "regular" you use a double motion. 
Also, note that your right hand moves in a slightly oval shape, (not just up
and down).  If you just move the right hand up and down without using the
oval movement (like signing the word "right" twice) the sign tends
to mean "appropriate or righteous."   Also, some people 
use the signDAILYto mean "regular."REGULAR:The right hand (or dominant hand) moves. The left hand doesn't move.The right hand travels in one and a half circles, striking the left hand 
twice and ending the movement shortly after the second strike.Sample sentence: Do you eat a lot or regular, which?
