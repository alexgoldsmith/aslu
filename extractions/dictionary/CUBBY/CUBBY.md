A cubby is a type of storage system common in classrooms of very 
			young children. The sign for a cubby is done by showing the sides 
			then the top and bottom of a cubby.CUBBY:A cubby:(Picture Credit: Kate Anderson of Springfield, 
			Oregon)Notes: The first 
			time you do the "cubby" sign in a conversation I recommend doing the 
			sign somewhat large -- representational of the actual size of the 
			cubby to which you are referring.  Then after your signing 
			partner is familiar with the topic for the rest of the conversation 
			you can do the sign smaller and more quickly.Question: "When signing "cubby," in the first picture 
			(showing the sides) I notice that you have your left hand higher 
			than the right. Is that part of the sign?"Answer: Ha! Um, not really, no. It is just because my brain 
			is/was anticipating the second part of the sign (showing the top and 
			bottom of the cubby) wherein my non-dominant hand is indeed higher 
			than my dominant hand.  Here, I'll post it again but this time 
			I'll do the first part of the sign with my hands perfectly even. (No 
			need to be so particular about it though. Unless you are OCD.)Note: Before you 
			ask, no it doesn't matter which hand is higher in the second part of 
			the sign.  I do it that way because it is somewhat similar to 
			the sign forBOX. (Except BOX is 
			horizontal not vertical.)Katewrites:"Cool! I love how simple and logical it is. Like the sign for "room" 
			but smaller?You will have to tell me if you get tired of my occasional emails 
			requesting a sign. Otherwise I am pretty sure I'll take advantage of 
			you. Please let me know. Seriously.- KateKateThe sign for CUBBY is like the sign for ROOM butupright.The sign for CUBBY really isn't much smaller than the typical sign 
			forROOM(the non-initializedASLform of which also happens to be the sign for BOX).  Both 
			"rooms" and "cubbies" are justtypesof boxes. It is the rest 
			of the sentence that helps us determine the specific meaning of the 
			"4 sides" sign.I'm always happy to receive sign requests from people. I just can't 
			always fulfill the request in a timely manner. When the semester 
			hits my email volume triples and my available time reduces by well 
			over half.- Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
