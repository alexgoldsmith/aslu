To sign DOG, just snap your fingers twice.This is an interesting sign because it is sort of based on the fingerspelled 
	word D-O-G as well as the common gesture of snapping your fingers to get a 
	dog's attention. Note: The snap always uses the middle finger, not the index 
	finger. The beginning handshape looks a bit like a modified "D" hand and the 
	ending handshape winds up looking like the letter "G." Thus the sign sort of 
	looks like you are spelling the letters "DG" which creates a "lexicalized" 
	version of the fingerspelled word "D-O-G."DOG:Notes:There are several different "right" ways to 
do the sign for dog.A popular sign for "dog" is
made by slapping your right flat hand against your leg, then snapping your fingers. Or you can snap your fingers 
	once  then slap your leg.Or you can slap your leg twice and not snap your fingers at all.My recommendation just use "lexicalized fingerspelling" 
	method I describe above  To do this, you fingerspell the letters "D" 
	and "G" very quickly and "snap" the middle finger on the base of the thumb 
	as you change from a modified "D" to a "G."OPTIONAL READING / ADVANCED DISCUSSION:n a message dated 1/14/2007 7:00:38 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, brittdun@gmail.com writes:Good afternoon Dr. Bill,My name is Brittany Dunlap. I am a

				and slap your abdomen? Or would your friend be totally confused

				any way around that situation, other than fingerspelling dog?Many thanks,Brittany D.Grove City, OH 43123-9084brittdun@Brittany,Hello :)The sign DOG actually hasfivevariations.  Oh, sure, people will tell 
		you THEIR version is right.Just smile sweetly and nod.If the person is your sign instructor then do it his or her way for 
		however long your class is. (Heh.)The 
        main 
		versions of "DOG" are:1.  Snap your fingers twice.2.  Snap your fingers 
		once.3.  Slap your thigh twice.4.  Snap your fingers once and then slap your thigh once.5.  Slap your thigh once and then snap your fingers.In your situation due to the table, the obvious choice is to use the 
		version that doesn't require hitting your leg.If I were you, I'd use the snap" version 
		of #DOG.A cool thing I want to point out is that the snap in this case is actually 
		what we call "lexicalized" fingerspelling.  Start with a modified "D" handshape 
		(with just the middle finger touching the thumb and the index finger 
		extended) and snap your middle finger and end up in a "G" handshape.  
		(Lexicalization means "the process of becoming like a lexeme." The word 
		"lexeme" means basic root words. So, what we are saying is that the 
		fingerspelling no longer looks or functions like typical fingerspelling, 
		it has changed to become like a "word" or sign.)As an adult communicating with other skilled adults I generally just sign 
	D-G (with a double snap). But on the other hand, when communicating with a young child I sometimes switch to the double-leg 
	pat.A Deaf coworker of mine has a pet peeve 
	regarding students (and instructors) who sign "DOG" in a redundant manner 
	(using both the snap and the pat). He doesn't like it a bit.I can 
		understand his point of view, but I also think it is important to be 
		flexible. For example, one of my daughters, Sarah, has no joints in her fingers and thus can't 
    really do fingerspelling or "snapping."  Guess which version of "dog" she 
		prefers?Cordially,-- Dr.

			used to mean "dog" in "ASL" would be during story-time forvery young children.A skilled signer might mime and/or role-play being a dog as part of 
			an entertaining skit or storytelling event forkids.During a typical conversation between two adult Deaf signers you arenotgoing to see one of them sticking 
			their tongue out and panting as a way of signing "dog." I suppose I 
			might use that sign to mean "panting" if I wanted to tell my wife 
			that our dog was "panting like crazy" after having taken her (the 
			dog, not the wife) out for a run. In such a situation I would be 
			actually be using the "PANTING" sign to mean "panting" and not to 
			mean "dog."Cordially,- Dr. Billp.s.Taking thewifeout for a run would involve other signs such 
			as HEART-ATTACK and AMBULANCE.Additionally,if someday she reads this- there will be signs 
			such as ASSAULT and DIVORCE.  Heh.
