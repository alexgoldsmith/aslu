MUCH / "a lot"Some things are not "countable." For example you can’t count “water.” You can 
  count “cups of water,” or “drops of water” but you can’tcountwater.When discussing things that are not “countable,” I recommend you use the sign “MUCH 
  / a lot” (volume).Sample sentence:YOUR FRENCH-FRIES, YOU SALT A-LOT? (Do you like a lot of salt on 
			your French fries?)When discussing “countable items” you should use “MANY,” 
  “how-MANY,” or the one-handed version of “how-MUCH?” (Which is often 
  interpreted as “how much” – as in “What is the cost of that?”)."How much?"-(countable)Sample sentence:WAITRESS, HOW-MUCH SHOULD T-I-P? (How much should you tip a 
			waitress?)Also see: "too-MUCH!"Also see: "a lot"You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
