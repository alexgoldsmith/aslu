QUESTION:A student writes:Is there a sign for "um" in ASL?  It seems that when 
			interpreting there should be some sign, or indication, or something 
			that would communicate "he/she is not saying anything, but is saying 
			something." Hopefully that makes sense. Do Deaf people have a 
			comparable sign or something like "um?"ANSWER:1.The typical "um" equivalent is to use a loose hand and rotate it in the 
			air (pivoting at the wrist) while using a facial expression that 
			looks like you are trying to think of something.2.Some people spell UMMMMMMM by doing a "U" and then sliding an "M." Thus 
			it is somewhat of a "joke sign."Want to help support
