American Sign Language:  "facebook"FACEBOOK:Most skilled Deaf signers do this sign by spelling the letters FB.FACEBOOK (2)(variation)This version is a pun that combines aspects of the signs for BOOK and FACE.Signing notes: As of early 2010 
this version is  for the most part simply an amusing neologism (emerging 
sign). It will beinteresting to track this version and see if it will become more widely used or if it will fade out over time. (Time will tell.)Also see:BOOKAlso see:FACE*
