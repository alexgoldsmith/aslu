To do the sign for "whisper"cup your passive hand at the side of your mouth and use your dominant hand 
	to do the sign for "TALK" 
	(The variation that uses a 4-hand at the mouth).Notes: Another way this sign is done is by leaning forward a bit, and cupping 
	your dominant hand at the side of your mouth (without needing to do the 
	"TALK" sign).
