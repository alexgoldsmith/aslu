American Sign Language:  "flash-the-lights"Note:
  Flashing the lights is a method of quickly getting the attention of a whole
  group of people.Getting attention this way should only be done by 
	people familiar with the Deaf Culture.  Newbies tend to overdo it. 
	(Flash too many times, too quickly, etc.)FLASH-the-lights:Open the hands, close the hands, and 
open them again. This is a way to tell someone to flash the overhead lighting 
off and on a couple times.Also see:LIGHT*
