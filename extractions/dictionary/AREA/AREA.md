There are a couple of different ways to sign "area."If you mean "area" as in that locale or "in that area," "around 
			there," "thereabouts," -- then use the version of "area" that uses a 
			"5"-handshape and moves in a horizontal circle.AREA:There is another sign for AREA that I really think you should know 
			about. It is based on the "PLACE" sign.What you do is you form your hands into "A"-handshapes. Then you 
			hold them out in front of you and trace a horizontal circle. I move from front to back.  But some people move from back to front.AREA (version)You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
