HIT or PUNCH:Notes:The sign "HIT" can be interpreted to mean, "occur" or "resulted in."I kid you not, quite a few people (mostly from Utah, heh) use the 
			sign "hit" to mean "punch" as in "FRUIT PUNCH."  When signing 
			to your ASL instructor though I recommend you instead sign "FRUIT 
			DRINK" or "FRUIT P-U-N-C-H" (spelling out "punch"). But hey, if I 
			don't tell you these things, who will? Last thing we need in the 
			Deaf community is a bunch of ASL students running aroundpunching 
			fruitat parties.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
