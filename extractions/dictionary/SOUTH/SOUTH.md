fs-C (similar to South Dakota). Just to to be sure our fingerspelling is not 
misread as NC.""South Dakota"Many people do a downward movement of an "S" for SOUTH followed by a regular 
spelling of the letter "D" for "South Dakota."You may occasionally see someone spell SD to mean "South Dakota.Using the SOUTH sign in SOUTH-DAKOTA followed by a "D" (instead of just 
fingerspelling"SD") helps to distinguish the sign from "San Diego" which is 
typically done by just spelling SD.Some people circle an "S" and change it into a "D" to mean "South Dakota."Also see:NORTHEASTWEST========================External examples of the "palm down" version of the sign for South"The version at "spreadthesign.com" under their "south" entry: https://media.spreadthesign.com/video/mp4/13/63581.mp4The 1:39 (time code) of this video: https://youtu.be/t386fjyHvkE?t=97The 24 second mark of this video: https://youtu.be/ohbo2X3bQoc?t=24The 9:47 mark of this video: https://youtu.be/hjuB-bDKljs?t=587*
