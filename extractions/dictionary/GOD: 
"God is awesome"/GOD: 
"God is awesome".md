Notes:The sign I use for awesome is commonly labeled as the sign for "WONDERFUL."Some people do the sign WONDERFUL with a high to low movement.  (They 
	do the first push up high, then the second push lower.)  I don't do it 
	that way because it conflicts with one of the popular variations of 
	"SUNDAY."GODAWESOME:
