The sign for "cold"means "cold 
	temperature."  Itdoesn'tmean "to have ahead-cold" or to be 
	sick.Use your arms to represent shivering.COLD:Sample sentence: "Do you like cold pizza?"To sign "very cold" use more facial expression, hunch your shoulders more, 
	and move the "shivering of your arms" faster and tighter.very-COLD:WINTER:Many people use the sign "COLD" to mean winter. This works well in 
  context but if there isn't much context I prefer to initialize the sign "winter" by using a "W" as the 
  handshape.REFRIGERATOR:You could sign refrigerator by initializing this sign, but  I
  recommend you just spell "REF."Here is a sign for refrigerator that initializes the sign COLD with "R" 
	handshapes to mean refrigerator:Remember, I recommend you just spell,
  R-E-F.
  Some people feel that the initialized form of the sign "refrigerator" is 
  signed English.  I disagree, but do the sign the way your local 
  instructor wants it just to be safe eh?You could also initialize the sign for "DOOR" to mean refrigerator.See:REFRIGERATOR
