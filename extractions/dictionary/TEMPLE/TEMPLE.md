TEMPLE (general version)There is another sign for temple that is used by Mormons. The 
			non-dominant index finger is held pointing up at an angle, (palm 
			back). The dominant index-finger-hand does a spiraling upward 
			movement and you end up touching index fingertips. Note: The index 
			finger doesn't wiggle or anything, the movement is in the wrist and 
			in the elbow (not in the large knuckle).TEMPLE:  ("Mormon" version = "LDS Temple")You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
