BROTHER:This sign starts with either a modified "L" hand or "G" hand 
	on the dominant hand and an "index finger" on the non-dominant hand.  
	Then the dominant hand moves downward while changing into an 
	"index" finger handshape at the end of the sign.Here is a variation of the sign for "brother."
This sign is made by first signing "male" or "boy" as if you were grabbing a cap. 
Next, bring both index fingers together in front of you. The second half of this sign (two index fingers close together, 
pointing forward) is one of the less common variations of the sign for "SAME."BROTHER ("boy-same" 
variation) (not recommended)Memory aid: BOY + SAME = BROTHER: Think of two boys from the 
same family.BROTHER (BOY-RIGHT variation)The sign for "brother-in-law" is a combination of the signs BROTHER andLAW.One of the more popular ways to sign "step-brother" is to combine the signs 
	for SECOND-HAND (or "his/her-TURN") and "brother." This is not an 
	insult. We use the "SECOND-HAND" sign since it is a way of saying that 
	something is in the next series not the first.STEP-BROTHER:Notes:Other methods of indicating "step" 
(as in "step-brother") include fingerspelling S-T-E-P, or signing 
"false."  But I prefer to use the sign "false-brother" to mean 
"foster brother."See:Brother
