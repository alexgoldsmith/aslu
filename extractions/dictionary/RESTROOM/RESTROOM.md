The sign for "restroom" is just an alternate (somewhat 
			more polite) way of signing "bathroom."  Use an "R" handshape 
			and make a movement similar to the sign for double digit numbers 
			(such as 22, 33, 44, etc.). Slap the hand forward and down a couple 
			of inches and then arch it up to the starting point and slap it down 
			an inch or two to the right (if you are right handed).RESTROOM:In an email message kellyann.burket writes:Good afternoon! I don't know if this is the right email to send this 
			question to, but I'll give it a shot. First of, I love your website! 
			It's really helped me expand my vocabulary. Second, I have a 
			question about the sign for "bathroom." I was taught the sign that 
			you use (to make a T and shake it). However, I've seen a couple 
			people use the sign for "ready" as the sign for "restroom." Is this 
			an alternate sign, or is it slang? Thanks!Kellyann BurketKellyann,Actually that sign is "RESTROOM" not "READY."RESTROOM bounces an R twice. After the first bounce it arcs up and 
			to the outside a bit. (As if drawing the letter "N" in the air with 
			the tip of an R-handshape).-- BillYou can learn
