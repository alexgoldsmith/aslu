SHOWER:animationAdditional reading (not needed for class).A student writes:How would u sign the verb, shower? Would it be the same as the noun? 
			Is shower a noun-verb pair?Response:I can see how SPRAY / SHOWER could be considered a noun/verb pair since 
		a single downward movement to mean "the water sprayed down" -- which 
		would be a verb (sprayed).  During high speed signing (native 
		level) it is common to sign something like "I SHOWER FINISH" using a 
		single movement for "SHOWER" which means "I finished showering" but 
		could also be interpreted as "I'm done with the shower."Real life: 
		When used in a sentence by a fluent ASL signer, "SHOWER" it 
		is often done with a single movement regardless if it is being used as a 
		verb or noun.If you signed, "I MUST FIX SHOWER" (to mean that you need to 
		repair your shower) -- it would be generally done with a 
		double movement.This sign is flexible though.  I wouldn't mark it wrong on a test if one 
		of my students did it either one or two movements.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
