American Sign Language: "friend"The sign for "friend" interlocks the index fingers twice.FRIEND:BOY-FRIEND:Some people do the full movement for the sign "friend" when signing "boyfriend" 
but my suggestion is to treat this sign like a typical compound sign and drop 
the second movement in the sign "friend."BOYFRIEND (compound):BOYFRIEND (full version):GIRL-FRIEND (compound version):GIRL-FRIEND (full version):GOOD-FRIENDLink your index fingers to show a bond. Pull it forward twice to show the bond 
is not easily broken.*
