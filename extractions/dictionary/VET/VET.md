The sign for VETis generally just fingerspelled:Sample video:SUPPOSE YOUR DOG SICK, YOU CARRY VET?Signing note: I notice that at high speed the letter "E" in the 
	fingerspelled sign "VET" tends to mutate into two bent fingers resting on 
	the thumb (since you recently used those two fingers to do the letter "V").Or, if needed for context, you could sign "ANIMAL+DOCTOR" the first time and 
	from then on spell V-E-TA student asked me if this spelling "V-E-T" could be used for "vet" as in amilitary 
  veteran.Yes, it can. You just have to remember "context." If it were me, the first 
	time around I'd sign, "HEARMYBEFORE HE" to 
  indicate that he was in the military.Also
