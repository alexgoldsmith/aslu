The concept of "hair" is often understood from context and thus doesn't need 
	a separate sign.  if you are describing someone and you do the sign 
	"STRAIGHT HAIR" there is no need to also do the sign HAIR.The general sign for "hair" starts as an open-"F"-hand held near 
	the head and then changes into a regular "F"-hand as the flat of the 
	thumbnail comes near and/or makes contact with the head.HAIR:The sign HAIR uses a "close, open, close" movement, but during high speed 
	signing of sentences it is common to use just a single movement. Especially 
	in compound signs like "brunette."CURLY-hair:Here is a general way to say, "straight hair."Move an upside down "4 hand" (straight fingers) downward however long the 
	hair is. In this example the hair would be straight and rather long.STRAIGHT-HAIR:To comment on the length of hair (without commenting on whether it is 
	straight or curly) you can use a "bent hand" to show the length of the hair. 
	Start at the head and then "drag" the hand down to the length of the hair.LONG HAIR:Sometimes you'll see the length done with two hands.  Usually you 
	wouldn't need to use two hands but if you were describing complex hair 
	styles or uneven hair lengths you would use two hands to be more clear and 
	precise.HAIR-LENGTH: "Hair down to the shoulders"Medium length hair:Movement: Twist your forearms twiceSHORTHAIR:Use a firm, decisive movement.Shoulder length hair:BUZZ-CUT:Here is another way to say, "Hair down to here."  If you added a side 
	to side wavy movement it would mean "wavy hair down to here." As it is below 
	though, the straight downward movement and the straight fingers refer to typical 
	"straight" hair.When describing the color of people's hair you can simply combine the sign 
	"hair" and the color of their hair. For example, "brunette" would be "HAIR+BROWN."BRUNETTE:Note:  To sign "blonde" you do the "Y"-hand version ofGOLDbut you start the movement by pointing at 
	the hair above the ear rather than by pointing at the earlobe.Yes, yes, that's right, I saved thebestfor last!  Here 
	is the sign for "no hair!"BALD:For more "bald" versions (since I know you can't get enough) see:BALD
