Tosign ACCENT (as in a variation in speech) form your dominant hand 
	into an index finger handshape and hold it near your throat. Move your hand 
	to your throat and make contact with the tip of your index finger.ACCENT:In a message dated 2/9/2006 6:17:14 AM Pacific Standard Time, Donna

	(lightly) with your index finger.  You can poke it either once or 
	twice. (But I only poke once.)  I agree with you in that what you have 
	is more of a "lisp" than an accent, but the interpreter was right in that a 
	"common" way of referring to signing that is different from the norm is to 
	refer to it as "having an accent."-- Dr. Bill
