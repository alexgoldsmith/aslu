Most of the time the concept of "USB drive" is clear if you simply spell 
	USB and then mime a "stick it in" movement.As a completely made up, fictitious example, suppose I were to lose my USB 
	drive.(Since Ineverlose my usb drive. Ahem.)I might sign to my wife:  YOU SEE MY USB RECENTLY?She would then instantly know I'm asking if she knows the location of my 
	"USB drive."However, suppose you are talking about various types of wires and cables.  
	If you spelled "USB" during that conversation it would refer to the a "USB 
	wire" not a "USB drive."  Thus the interpreted meaning depends on 
	context.So, if you really and truly needed to indicate specifically a USBdrive, 
	(the kind you plug into a computer), then you would spell USB and use a 
	"Classifier: G" or a "closed X" to mime the process of plugging a USB drive 
	into a computer.USB Drive:Spell USB, then mime plugging in a USB drive.You can use either a "G" handshape like below, or a "Closed X" handshape 
	like above as you mime the process of sticking a USB drive into a port on 
	your computer.p.s. Just in case you were wondering, USB stands for Universal Serial Bus.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
