American Sign Language: "symbol"SYMBOL (version 1)The general sign for "symbol" is an initialized version of the sign for "show" 
(as in to demonstrate or reveal something). The sign is done by putting an 
"S"-hand onto the palm of the non-dominant flat hand and moving both hands 
forward a short distance (about 10 centimeters). This sign seems to be a loose 
noun/verb pair. If done with a single somewhat larger movement the sign takes on 
a meaning such as "symbolize," "symbolizes," or "to symbolize."  A small 
double movement definitely means "symbol."  However, in casual or high 
speed signing you may see the sign done with a single movement yet with the 
intended meaning of "symbol."Notes:Someone may try to tell you that this sign is not ASL and is instead "Signed 
English" (with the underlying criticism that Signed English is "bad" or has 
cooties). I think it is possible to argue that this sign is indeed ASL. (The 
debate going like this: So, what you are saying is that since this sign uses an 
"S" handshape it is signed English?  Oh, okay -- then I guess the signs for 
aunt, uncle, and the days of the week are all Signed English too?)  The 
fact is, just because something is initializeddoesn'tautomatically mean 
it is Signed English. Another fact is two different languages (or communication 
systems) can each use the same word (or sign).While you "could" express the concept of "symbol" by using a combination of 
"context" and the sign for "SHOW" (and there are those who would additionally 
mouth the word "symbol") -- I would suggest however that in mixed language 
environments (such as a typical public high school class being attended by a 
Deaf student and his/her interpreter) it is quite effective to have a sign that 
"specifically" means symbol.  Suppose the instructor says, "Show me an 
example of a symbol that represents what I'm trying to demonstrate."See:SHOW*
