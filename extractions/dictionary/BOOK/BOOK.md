The sign for "book" uses "flat" hands.BOOK (use a double motion)Sample sentence: "What is your favorite book?"= "YOUR FAVORITE BOOK, what-NAME?"Notes:In the sentence example above, I use an almost imperceptible second movement on 
the sign BOOK.Most of the time you can just open the hands once and people will know that 
	you are referring to a book.  Technically, the sign BOOK is a noun/verb pair.  If you use a double motion it means
book.  If you use a single motion it means "open book."  If
you reverse the motion  by starting with the hands open and then closing
them, it means "close the book" or "close your books."BOOK:CLOSE-BOOK:OPEN-BOOK:See:bookstore
