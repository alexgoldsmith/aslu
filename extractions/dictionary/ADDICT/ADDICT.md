ASL: "addict"ADDICTED / hookedNote: I'm not sticking my finger in my mouth.  I'm just pressing the tip of 
an "X" handshape into my cheek near the corner of my mouth. Then I pull my head 
to the side as if representing a fish that has been "hooked."ADDICT:To turn the sign "addicted" into "addict," just add the "person" sign after the 
sign "addicted."Notes:*
