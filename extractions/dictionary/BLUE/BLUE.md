BLUE:The sign for "blue" is made by forming the letter "b" with your right hand.Twist/shake your hand from the elbow (the wrist doesn't bend on this sign).Here is an example of BLUE:  YOUR DAD EYES BLUE? (Are your dad's eyes 
blue?)BLUE (variation)You might also see this sign done pointing upward more than forward.Both versions are okay.  The sign isn't necessarily forward or upward, it 
is just a "B" hand held at a comfortable angle and the forearm twisted twice.Signing note: You would NOT use the 
sign "BLUE" to mean "depressed."Related sign:BLUE-RAY
