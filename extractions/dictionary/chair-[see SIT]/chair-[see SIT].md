The sign for "CHAIR/sit" is a classic "noun/verb" pair.The noun, CHAIR, has a smaller, double movement.The verb, SIT, has a larger, single movement.CHAIR: [noun--double movement]  (Do the sign "sit" twice.)SIT:This sign is the "verb" form of the sign "CHAIR."  You just do the first 
	half of the sign "CHAIR."  One quick motion.Note: See the "SIT" page for advanced forms of 
	this sign.BENCH: One movement.  Modified form of  
	"CHAIR."This sign could also be used to indicate a row of people sitting.COUCH:This is a combination of "SIT" and "C" classifier handshapes to show the 
	shape of a couch.ANXIOUS:The sign "SIT" can be modified to show someone squirming in their chair.  
	This can be used to mean "anxiety" and similar concepts.Notes:A student asked me, "How do you 
	sign 'long time.'"My response involved the sign "sit" so I'm including it here:In general I just do the signs "LONG" and then "TIME."Butif you are signing something like, "Isatfor a long 
	time" you would modify the verb SIT with a "temporal inflection." What I 
	mean by that is...you would do the sign for "SIT"...then you would move both 
	hands up an inch, forward, down, and back (keeping your hands together--or 
	shall we say, "keeping your buns on the chair") using a circular motion. 
	This movement means that you have been "sitting for a long time"--so in that 
	case you wouldnot needa separate sign for "long time." The concept 
	of "long time" would be shown by the way you move the sign.Also see:SWINGAlso see:SIT
