The sign for ringing as in "a ringing phone" (or an alarm) is done 
			by whacking (that is atechnicalterm folks) an index finger 
			up against the palm of the non-dominant hand twice.Notes:If you mean "ringing" as in my ears are ringing you might indeed see 
			some people sign: MY EAR RINGING using the above sign but if you are 
			taking about a hearing aid squealing then instead use an "E" 
			handshape near the ear and move it out away from the ear using a bit 
			of a wobbly movement.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
