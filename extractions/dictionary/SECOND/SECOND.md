The right sign for "second" depends on what you 
	mean.If you mean "second" as in "one second of time" or "there are 60 
	seconds in a minute" you can do a "quick" version of the sign for "minute."Yes, that is right, the sign for "minute" is often used to mean 
	"second."I know that isinefficient.  Having two concepts that use the same exact 
	sign and rely on context (or a mouth movement to distinguish between the two 
	meanings) is confusing.  Hey, I didn'tinventthe language, I'm justteachingit to you.Do a
  very quick twitch of the right hand in an "index finger" handshape.  Have it do one
  "tick" of the clock. The movement is from the wrist and pivots on
  the heel of the other hand.  Remember, the movement is small and quick.SECOND:SECOND (fingerspelled)Compare:MINUTESample sentence: "One minute has how many seconds?"If you are discussing duration of time and you need to clearly distinguish 
	between a "minute" and a "second" -- you can spell them out.  M-I-N and 
	S-E-C.Or sign "MINUTE" and spell S-E-C."second"= S-E-C:Notes and optional reading:"Second hand"In a message dated 10/29/2006 1:23:31 PM Pacific Standard Time, rollendonner@ writes:Dr. Bill,I learned a "new" sign today that [my]

		movement is a forward/sideward roll with a quick ending.If yourollthe sign toward a person that sign can also be used to mean, "it's your turn."When this sign is used for cars it means "a second-hand car."- Dr.

		"SECOND."That version of the sign SECOND is what I'd call an "initialized" 
		version. It uses the initial of the English word "second" as the 
		handshape for the sign "SECOND." As an ASL instructor I would classify 
		that version as "Signed English."Some people might be tempted to knee jerk react and say that your Deaf 
		friend doesn't sign ASL. It has been my observation however that quite a 
		few skilled ASL users use initialization from time to time and borrow 
		signs liberally from Signed English according to convenience. Whether or 
		not such signs "jump the gap" and become an accepted part of ASL -- only 
		time will tell. As ofright nowthough I wouldNOTrecommend using that 
		version. If in doubt, just spell S-E-C.But THANK YOU for the input. Seriously I appreciate it.Cordially,Dr. Bill
