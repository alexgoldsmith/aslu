				"babies"so to speak.  We started signing 6 months ago and we love it.My question is:  How would one sign the Spanish letter "ñ"?  
				Thatletter appears in many forms in English text and does crossover 
				to SignLanguage.  For example; the phenomenon call "El Niño" and the 
				related"La Niña."  We have a city in California named "Los Baños."  
				There aremany Spanish surnames that if spelled-out would require an "ñ" 
				likeNuñez, Ibañez, etc.Please share your thoughts on this subject.George,I don't know the sign for ñ. But why don't you try asking a 
				contact ofmine down in Mexico:Robin DeLaRosaApartado 640Cabo San Lucas, BCSCP 23450     Mexicojsfreaky@Robin knows MSL and some native MSL users who might have a sign 
				you could use. If you find out a good sign for ñ, please do let 
				me know.Cordially,Bill Vicars
