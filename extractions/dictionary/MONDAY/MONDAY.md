The sign for "Monday" is generally done "palm 
	up." Some ASL books show the sign MONDAY being done with the palm facing down.I have a
  number of associates who consider the palm up/back version to be "more
  ASL." I think that perhaps a better way to phrase that 
	would be to say that "during everyday conversation most skilled native Deaf 
	ASL signers tend to do the sign for Monday with their palm facing up and/or back."The palm down version isstillASL, but it is more along the lines of 
	motherese or "teacherese" -- a "beginner
  version" of the sign often taught to 1st semester ASL students.  The 
	palm down version can also be used for emphasis and clarity.Sample sentence: "Do you like Mondays?" = YOU LIKE MONDAY?MONDAY:EVERY-MONDAY.  (Note:  Each of the days of the week can be made
  plural by holding the sign a bit higher, then dragging it straight down a foot
  or two.)See:SUNDAY/ MONDAY /TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY/FRIDAY/SATURDAY
