American Sign Language: "ham"HAM:Just fingerspell the letters H-A-M.Also see:PIGNotes:A student writes:  "I was just surprised to learn that "ham" didn't 
have its own unique sign. We have "bacon" or many other much less commonly used 
words that have a sign.:Dr. Bill responds:The letters of the word "ham" are so easy to fingerspell that it would be 
counterproductive to have a separate sign for "ham."  We Deaf tend to 
fingerspell at around two-tenths of a second per letter or faster. Thus (for a 
skilled signer) "H-A-M" is only going to take around six-tenths of a second to 
fingerspell (after you've moved your hand to the initial starting position).*
