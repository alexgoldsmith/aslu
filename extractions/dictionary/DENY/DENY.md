To sign "deny," form both hands into open-"A"-hands.  What that 
			means is make "A" hands but stick the thumbs out.Hold both thumbs under your chin with the pad of each thumb touching 
			the underside of the chin.  Quickly move both hands forward.This sign is very close to the sign for "NOT" except that the NOT 
			sign only uses the dominant hand.DENY:Also see:NOTYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
