The general sign for ALL can mean 
"whole" or "entire."ALL:There is also alexicalized version of "ALL.""Lexicalized" means that it used to be just fingerspelling but over
time it took on characteristics of a word and not just individually spelled
letters. The location moves, sometimes letters are dropped or only partially
formed. You can use the lexicalized form #ALL to mean the same thing as the sign
"ALL."  Notice the # mark?  When you see that in front of a
sign in an ASL book it means "lexicalized fingerspelling."ALL (lexicalized)The lexicalized sign #ALL is a type of sign that began as fingerspelling and 
eventually evolved into a sign distinct from the way fingespelling normally 
occurs.Note:
"Lexicalized" fingerspelled wordsused to becalled "loan
signs."
Some people still call lexicalized fingerspelled words "loan signs"
but the term "loan sign" more accurately applies to signs that were
"borrowed" from other signed languages and became part of ASL.Below is another way to say "ALL" by using a lexicalized form. 
Notice:  I'm using two hands, more facial expression, and a larger movement
than in the previous version.  This shows more emphasis. Sort of like
raising your voice and stressing the word "all" when speaking.AnimationsAnimation 1:  General sign for ALL:Animation 2:#ALL-(one
