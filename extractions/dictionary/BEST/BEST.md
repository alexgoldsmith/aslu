American Sign Language:  "best"BEST:"BEST" and "BETTER" are derivatives of "GOOD."Memory Aid:  An interesting way to think of "BETTER" is as a combination of
  "GOOD + ER," and "BEST" as a combination of "GOOD +
  EST."GOOD:  (For more info, check out the "GOOD"
  page.)BETTER:The sign for better comes out to the right a bit.BEST:Notice that the sign for BEST makes a much bigger movement.  It actually
  dips down a bit for emphasis prior to moving "way up."  The
  more you exaggerate this sign, the more your are emphasizing how much better
  something is than the others.*
