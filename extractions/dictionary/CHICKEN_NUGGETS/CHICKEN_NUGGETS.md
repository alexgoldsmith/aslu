Hello,My daughter is hearing impaired and trying to teach my grandsons sign language. They 
				will be 3 and 4 years old in August. They love chicken nuggets and we can't find a sign for nuggets anywhere. Do 
				you know of one or does it just have to be fingerspelled? I feel stupid asking this question and taking up your 
				time, but I told my daughter that I would try to find out for her.Thank You,Nelly S. Briggs
