The general sign for pound can be used to mean several "weight" related concepts.POUND / WEIGH / TON:Both hands form "H" shapes. The dominant "H" rocks back and forth on top of the 
	non-dominant "H" in a quick double movement. 
  The non-dominant hand doesn't move during this sign.Here is a view of that sign from an angle:POUND:  (alternate method)When you are specifically talking about "pounds" you can use either the 
  "pound/weigh/ton" sign above, or you can spell the letters "L" and "B."   
  When you use the fingerspelled version you donotadd an "S" to 
  indicate the plural "pounds." Instead you pluralize this concept by stating 
  the number of pounds, for example:  15 LB.LB:Notes:If you mean pound as in "dogpound" you shouldnotuse the above signs for 
			"POUND"-(weight/weigh/ton).Instead you should spell "pound."If you mean "pound" as in "the boxer pounded on 
			his opponent" or the cook pounded on the chicken you should use a 
			mimed version ofHITwherein you throw a 
			few mock punches (using a serious, focused facial expression) or you 
			mime hitting a (dead, plucked, and cleaned) chicken with a food 
			mallet.See:OUNCEYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
