There are a couple of different ways to sign "center."CENTER:
(bent middle finger variation)Center or Middle (flat hand 
variation)You can do the dominant handshape with either a flat hand or you can use a 
	middle finger bent forward from the large knuckle. 
  This sign is can be combined with DEAF to mean "Deaf Center."MIDDLE:Here is a lesser used variation of "middle."  I wouldn't use this for 
	"center."This version means more along the lines of "the middle of a series" or 
	"middle name."
