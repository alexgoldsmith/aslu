The sign for "turkey" (as in, we eat "turkey" onThanksgiving) is done by holding a "Q" under, on, or near your chin.Wiggle ita couple times as if it were a 
  "wattle." (And in case you were wondering, a wattle is the reddish thing that 
  hangs off a turkey's neck.)TURKEY-(bird)Notes:In a message dated 2/4/2007 8:07:59 P.M. Pacific Standard Time, Glopsey

			don't like it. I think it's cute! What's your take on it?Thanks much!SaraASL student (not majoring, just for fun!!!)Sara,I love that sign!It is a clever, playful use of the language.  I wouldn't use it for 
			serious communication, but it is a lot of fun. I call such signs 
			"joke" signs -- meaning they are not actually used by native adult 
			Deaf people for conversation but rather they are used for "playing 
			around."Let me share with you another version of that "playful" sign for 
			"turkey": Form one of your hands (generally your dominant hand) into a "five" handshape, 
			and the other hand into an "i" 
	handshape.  You press the thumb side of the "I" handshape up against 
	the palm of the "5" hand.  The "5"-hand represents the tail feathers.  
	The pinkie of the "i"-hand represents the neck and head.-- Dr. BillIn a message dated 3/25/2007 10:41:38 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time,

		You make a "C" withjust the thumb and indexfinger, sort of like
