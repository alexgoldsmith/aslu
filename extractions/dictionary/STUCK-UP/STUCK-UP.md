The sign for "stuck up" is the same as the typical American 
	gesture for stuck up.(The pinkie is optional.)STUCK-UP:Here is a sideways view.Again, you don't "need" the pinkie. The sign is correct with our without 
	sticking the pinkie in the air.Sample sentence:  "Do you think cats are stuck up?" = YOU THINK CAT

	-- it is just a variation.  You might see that sort of thing in other 
	signs too though. For example, you might see someone sign "GIVE-UP U-P" 
	wherein they sign "GIVE-UP" and then at the end of the sign add the letters 
	"U" and "P."  Adding that extra couple of letters isn't actually part 
	of the "official" sign, it just happens from time to time -- especially if 
	you are trying to show emphasis.Cordially,- Dr. Bill
