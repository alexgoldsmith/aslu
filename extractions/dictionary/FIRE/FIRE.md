ASL University ►American Sign Language:  "FIRE-flame" 
vs "FIRE-terminate"  (see below)First of all, 
what do you mean?  Do you mean "fire" as in "lose your job"? 
Or do you
mean fire as in "liar, liar, pants onfire"?If you mean "fired" as in "lose your job" the 
do the "terminate from employment" sign.FIRE-terminate:Memory Aid:  It is not hard to imagine that this sign is based on the idea 
of grabbing someone's
neck and chopping off their head.  (Hey, I didn't come up with this sign, 
I'm just showing it to you!)Note: You might also see the above sign done with an "E" handshape (palm up) on 
the dominant hand to mean "excommunicate."Another version of "fire" as in "lose job"uses an index finger on the non-dominant hand (instead of a fist).FIRE-terminate 
(version 2)This is an "initialized version" that uses the letter "F."  While I don't 
recommend using it, you just might see this version from time to time.FIRE-terminate (version) (notrecommended)
