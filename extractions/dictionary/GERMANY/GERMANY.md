The sign for "Germany" has a couple of versions. They 
			are both worth knowing.In this first version of Germany you cross your hands (in "5-handshapes") 
	and then flutter the fingers.GERMAN / GERMANY (Version 1)There is another way to sign "Germany." This other way is based on the old 
	German military helmet with the pointy emblem on the top.This is a "real" sign, (I'm not making this up). I personally recommend you 
	stick with the version above, but some people prefer the "pointy helmet" 
	version.Tap the large knuckle of your right "index finger" on your upper forehead 
  twice.Note: That is an index finger NOT and "L" hand.  Tuck the thumb in.Germany / German: (Version 2)You can learn AmericanSign
