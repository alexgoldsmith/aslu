The sign for "basket" uses "C" handshapes.  The "C" handshapes
in this sign are functioning as "classifiers" or what might be written
as "C:CL" or "CL:C."  What it is classifying is a whole
range of large cylindrical objects like telephone poles, garbage cans, or (in my
home) laundry baskets.  We use tall round laundry baskets for dirty clothes
and the shorter/wider baskets for clean clothes.Note:  The "typical" sign for basket would use slightly curved
"B" palms (with the thumbs alongside rather than across the palm), to
show the shape of the basket--starting from the bottom center to the top sides.You can also add a handle to the basket:Large, tall, cylindrical object:You can adjust the size of your basket.  Here I'm showing a somewhat 
larger "hamper."  Also, I'm sitting down as I sign this so the sign seems 
higher than if I were signing while standing up:Student: Does the default meaning for the sign "basket" tend to be 
"garbage"? If I wanted to sign "basket", would people first assume I meant 
"garbage"? Or is this one of those matters-of-context?Dr. Bill:  No.  I don't use basket for garbage.  I might use the 
basket/cylinder sign after the sign garbage to mean "garbage CAN."GARBAGEhas its own sign.
