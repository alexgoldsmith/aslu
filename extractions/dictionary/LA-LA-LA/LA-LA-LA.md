American Sign Language: "la 
		la la"A student writes:Merry Christmas, Dr. Bill! :)I was interpreting a Christmas movie for practice earlier today, 
				and felt stumped on the song "Deck the Halls."How would you interpret "fa la la la la, la la la la?"With interpreting I know you figure out the meaning, not the 
				surface of the actual words. But...what does "fa la la" mean?Thanks,Name on fileDear ______,Hello :)Nonsensical aspects of voiced songs (such as "la la la" that delight the 
	ears (but do nothing for the eyes) is one of the inherent challenges in 
	interpreting music.One approach is to simply acknowledge that sometimes due to trying to please 
	both the ear and the eye at the same time (as happens when we sign songs) we 
	are bridging two languages and often what we are producing is not an ASL 
	translation but rather a hybrid linguistic mutant product that has its own 
	kind of beauty and utility.To answer your question -- you can show "la la la" by fingerspelling 
	"L-A--L-A--L-A" with both hands moving outward toward your sides 
	dramatically.I might ask you this:  What does "la la la" mean? Heh. If you want a truly 
	ASL interpretation of that song, figure out what "la la la" means and then 
	signthat!Seems to me "la la la" is simply your tongue dancing around in your mouth 
	and that the equivalent in an ASL rendition of the song would be to do a 
	beautiful, flowing, rhythmic -- but basically meaningless bit of "dancing" 
	with your hands and/or body. (Expect opinions to differ on this one.)-- Dr. BillNotes:*
