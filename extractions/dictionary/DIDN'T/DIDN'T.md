The right sign for "didn't" depends on the situation.●  Often the concept of "didn't"is 
			expressed via anegative shake of the headwhile 
			signing that which you didn't do or which didn't happen.For example, to sign, "I didn't go" --  you would shake 
			your head negatively while signing "GO."This is sometimes written (glossed) as "PRO-1 GO-[neg]"That "PRO-1" can be thought of as meaning "first person pronoun" 
			which means "I or me."●In addition to using thenegative head shakeyou can 
			add the "NOT" sign to your sentence.For example: "PRO-1 NOT GO-[neg]."●Sometimes the concept of "didn't" 
			is incorporated into the movement of the sign. This happens with the 
			following signs:WANT+ a reversal 
			of orientation becomes "don't-WANT" -- which can be included in such 
			sentences as: "PRO-3 don't-WANT GO" -- which could be interpreted 
			as, "He (or she) didn't want to go."KNOW+ a reversal of orientation 
			becomes "don't-KNOW"-- which can be included in such sentences as: "PRO-3 don't-KNOW 
			HOW" -- which could be interpreted as, "He (or she) didn't know 
			how."LIKE+ a reversal of orientation 
			becomes "don't-LIKE"-- which can be included in such sentences as: 
			"PRO-3 don't-LIKE I-T" -- which could be interpreted as, "He (or 
			she) didn't like it."● Another 
			way the "didn't" concept might come up is in the sign for 
			"don't-MIND."  If asked if you found something annoying 
			(BOTHER), you might reply "I don't-MIND" which could be interpreted 
			as "I didn't mind it."Some
