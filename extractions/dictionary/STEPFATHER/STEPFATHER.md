The sign for "step-father" has a few variations.A very popular version of the sign for "stepfather" uses the sign for "second" as in "second-hand" or "turn-taking."  The sign for "second hand" has many meanings including, 
	"used" as in a "used car" or with a bit larger movement it can mean "your 
	turn."  This is not meant to be an insult. In ASL it is simply a 
	way torefer to the idea that a stepfather is "taking a 
	turn at being someone's father."In this version you combine the signs for "SECOND-HAND" and "FATHER."STEP-FATHER (second-hand version)It is also very common to simply spell S-T-E-P and then sign FATHER.There is a version of stepfather that combines "FALSE" + "DAD."I personally don't like using it for stepfather since I use it to mean "fosterfather."STEPFATHER (false dad version)There is a version of stepfather in which the index finger moves down and 
	back up using a very quick movement.STEPFATHER:  (one finger variation)While I don't tend to use the "one finger" variation for STEPMOTHER, I got 
	an email from Dr. Lisalee Egbert. She uses the one-handed version for both 
	stepmother and stepfather.Notes from Dr. Bill regarding the "one finger variation" of STEPFATHER and 
	STEPMOTHER:A "one movement/one location" sign has an advantage over a "two movement/two 
	location" sign since the single movement sign has "economy" in its favor. 
	The "one finger" sign is a strong variation in some parts of the country and 
	I think it is actually increasing in popularity. I can certainly see why Dr. 
	Egbert would use it and I think it is a terrific sign. For me personally 
	though I think I'll still stick with the "second hand" version of 
	"stepfather/stepmother" as the version I teach my own classes. Also remember 
	the "safest" version will likely be to spell STEP when used as part of the 
	sign for "stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, etc."STEPMOTHERSTEPMOTHER:  another version:Just in case you are wondering, here is the sign for "STEP." This is
  a version of the sign for walk that only takes "one step."  Do 
	NOT use this sign as part of the sign for step-father during an ASL test  
	(unless you want to give your instructor a chuckle).
