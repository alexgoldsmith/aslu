THICK-PIZZA: Deep DishThere are quite a few ways to signPIZZA.  
			Do one of them and then sign THICK.In my example (below) I'm spelling "pizza" using a lexicalized form 
			that overlaps the letters (note the second frame where the "P" and 
			the "I" are both visible at the same time) and uses the "double-Z" 
			(based on a "V" hand moving in a "Z" pattern).Then I use "C" handshapes to show how thick I want my pizza.  
			Okay, sure, I'm hamming it up a bit here (because pizza gets me 
			excited) but in ASL you've got to get used to using your face or 
			your stories will be boring.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
