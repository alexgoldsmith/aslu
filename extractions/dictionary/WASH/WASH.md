The 
	right sign for "wash" depends on your concept.The general sign for "wash" is
made by closing both hands into "A" hands with your dominant hand on top.
Make a circular "scrubbing" movement with the hand that is on top--as if washing 
something. The hand on the bottom doesn't move.WASH (general sign)Wash a car or a wall:Memory aid:  "Wax on, wax off." Good thing you learned this sign, now you 
can defend yourself.(If you don't get that joke, watch the ORIGINAL Karate Kid.  Yes, I'mthatold.)Wash a dish:The dominant hand moves in a circle. The non-dominant hand represents the dish being washed.Wash a load of laundry (clothes), or a "washing machine."  
Both hands twist, return to their starting point and twist again. Think of 
loosening a jar, tightening it, and loosening it again.Note:The sign DIGEST is similar to the general version of the sign for WASH 
	except that DIGEST tends to be done somewhat lower and more near the 
	stomach.
