There are several ways to do The sign for "babysitter" .  One is to sign "baby" and
  a shortened form of the sign "take-care-of" +
  "agent." Which means "keep" or baby keeper."The other is to sign "baby" +
  "sit" + "agent."BABYSITTER (baby + keep + person)Some people will try to tell you that the "baby" + "sit"
  version is not "ASL."  I think it is. Let's face it, many, many
  deaf people use the "sit" version.  Learn them both and don't
  worry about it.Babysitter:"babysitter"Version:  BABY-WATCHERSign "BABY" then use a two handed "LOOK-at" with a double movement, pointed 
	forward and downward as if looking at a baby in a crib.Notes:No need to readbelow for your ASL class.In a message dated 10/21/2008 8:38:51 A.M. Pacific Daylight Time,

		Washington D.C.  (The areas where I have lived.)Of course I realize that doesn't mean it isn't used by people in those 
		areas, but for what it is worth, I haven't seen it.I will ask my colleagues to see if they've seen that variation and if

		mutated into the movement you describe.--BillNote: Cornelia Loose is an undergrad from Germany working on her thesis
