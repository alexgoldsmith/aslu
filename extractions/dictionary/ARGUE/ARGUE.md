Think of how people point fingers at each other when they argue.ARGUE:Version 1:  The fingers go up and down together:Version 2:  The fingers uses an alternating movement.Notes:Interesting -- I found that when I signed version 2 to myself
  "off camera" I tended to open my mouth (a bit) and cover my bottom
  teeth with my tongue.  (Which is to say, my tongue was touching the

  I didn't use the tongue in the first version.  I'll have to video other
  people signing these two versions and see if anyone else does that.You can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
