American Sign 
	Language: "sloppy"SLOPPY:QUESTION:A student asks:  "When you have a moment, I’d like to run something past 
you. According to one of my ASL dictionaries, the sign for “farm” and “farmer” 
is the same as the sign for “sloppy” and “bum.” This seems quite disrespectful 
to me and I was wondering if you know how this sign came about. I appreciate how 
hard farmers work (especially in the past when there was no modern equipment). 
It just seems odd to me that a culture who fought (and still fights) for respect 
would choose to refer to another “culture” in a manner that (appears) 
disrespectful. Or am I completely off-base on this?- Name on fileANSWER:Dear Student,While there are some similarities between the signs "FARM" and "SLOPPY" -- these 
are definitely two different signs.  The movement of the sign for SLOPPY 
has a "flinging" motion at the end of the sign as if flinging slop from your 
hand.  Whereas the sign for "FARM" ends after it crosses the chin.  
Additionally the facial expression is much different between the two signs.  
SLOPPY uses a disgusted or sometimes careless facial expression (depending on 
the connotation of the sign).-Dr. BillAlso see:FARM*
