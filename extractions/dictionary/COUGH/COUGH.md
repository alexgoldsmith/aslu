There are at least three ways to do the sign for "cough."  In my opinion, neither 
  is more correct than the other. Personally I do version 1. My friend Roy tends to do version 2.COUGH:  Version 1:Animation: Cough:COUGH (version 2)Animation: Cough Version 2COUGH (version 3)or "cough cough"Animation:  COUGH Version 3Note:  Version 3, the one where you hit your chest with the 
			thumb-side of your fist a couple times, is sometimes used as a 
			snarky comment to mean that a thing is of questionable quality.If you tell people about your wonderful new idea or your cool new 
			purchase and someone in the group looks at someone else or rolls his 
			eyes and signs "cough cough" -- it means you might want to curb your 
			enthusiasm a bit.An interesting example of this derogatory meaning is shown in how 
			the "COUGH COUGH" sign has mutated into a joke sign for Walmart 
			wherein a person touches a W to his or her chin (as if doing the 
			sign for WATER) and then moves the hand down and strikes the chest 
			with an "M" similar to how how a person might strike their chest if 
			they were coughing. For Wal-Mart just use a single movement. Also
