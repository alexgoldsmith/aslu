The sign for "people"is done three or more different ways.(Pity the poor unsuspecting ASL student--especially those taking a class from 
	a "my way is therightway" type of instructor).I personally useforwardalternating rotational movement (as if 
	pedaling a bicycle forward).Many of my friends and associates also use a forward rotational movement.Some of my friends and associates use abackwardrotational movement.A few use an up and down alternating movement.PEOPLE:Sample sentence: What kind of people do you like?"For another sample of "people" see: See: "animation."PERSON/ agent/ "one who does"(singular)This sign, in general, means "person."Â  It can be used to mean "one who does something."
  For example, when used with teach, (TEACH + PERSON) it means
  "teacher."PERSON:Note: It is also very common to see "PERSON" initialized with "P" 
	handshapes.
