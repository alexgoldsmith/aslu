A fellow named "Aries" writes:Dr. Vicars,How would you sign

		both languages you might see someone sign: "LESS-THAN GUESS" to mean 
		underestimate.How you express "underestimate" in ASL will depend on what is being 
		underestimated.For example, if I underestimated an opponent's physical strength, I 
		might sign:I THOUGHT HIM WEAK. WRONG! HE STRONG!If I have underestimated a test:I THOUGHT TEST "NOTHING-TO-IT."  HIT-(me in the face). 
		TEST HARD!If I have underestimated expenses or money:I FIGURED 50 DOLLAR.  not-ENOUGH.I THOUGHT I NEED 50 DOLLAR. NEED MORE.Thus there are many, many ways to express the concept of "underestimate" 
		(rather than one specific way).If it were to be used again and again in a spoken lecture I would not 
		mind if the interpreter signed "LESS-than ESTIMATE-(guess)"Cordially,Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
