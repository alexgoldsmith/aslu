"A plant," spring-time, bush, garden:Note: If you do the sign "plant / spring / bush / garden" using only a 
	single movement it would tend to mean "GROW."Note:  When signing "GARDEN" I tend to sign "GROW" (using a small 
	movement) and then shift the sign location to the right a couple inches and 
	sign "GROW" again. That shows more than one plant growing.Some people feel the "initialized" version of "plant" is not an ASL sign. 
	I'm going to show it to you here so you can recognize it.  I suggest 
	you use the "plant / spring / bush / garden" version (above) instead of the 
	initialized version. Also see the "spring" 
  page.PLANT (initialized version)Animation:PLANT SEEDS:Rub your fingers together as you move your hand forward--as if dropping seeds
