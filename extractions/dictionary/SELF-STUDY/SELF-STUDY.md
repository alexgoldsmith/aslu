To do the sign for SELF-STUDY you start with an "A" handshape in 
			front of your chest. If you are right handed, the palm-side of the 
			"A"-hand is toward your left.  Bring the thumb-side of the 
			"A"-hand back to your chest. Note: you are not "jabbing" your chest 
			with the tip of your thumb, rather you are bringing the whole length 
			of the thumb into contact with your chest.SELF-STUDY:Animation: "SELF-STUDY"Notes:The phrase "self-study" is a compound sign. By that I mean you are 
			compounding the signs SELF and STUDY into one concept "SELF-STUDY."The sign SELF is normally done using a double movement when used to 
			mean "myself" or "my own."  When used as part of the compound 
			sign "SELF-STUDY" the second movement (of the sign SELF) is dropped.  
			Additionally, the most common version of the sign for STUDY tends to 
			use a fluttering of the fingers.  In the compound sign 
			SELF-STUDY the fluttering movement of the sign STUDY is reduced.Also see:SELFAlso see:STUDYYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
