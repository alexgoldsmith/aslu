ASL: "uncanny"The word "uncanny" has quite a few interpretations depending on your exact 
meaning.If you mean "strange" then use the sign for "STRANGE.""Uncanny Resemblance."According to Neil Turner in a "Quora" comment: "The phrase ["uncanny 
resemblance"] used about two objects, quite often people, looking so similar 
that it feels as though there should be an unnatural or supernatural reason for 
it. You probably should not use [the phrase] to describe identical twins, since 
the resemblance is entirely expected and explained by genetics. It is more 
likely to be used of a so-called doppelganger, a person who so resembles someone 
else unrelated that it seems there must be some other-worldly explanation."Source: Turner, N. (11/17/2016), "What does the phrase 'the

https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-phrase-the-resemblance-is-uncanny-meanIf by "uncanny resemblance" you mean that two things have an amazingly strong 
resemblance then you could use a combination of LOOK-STRONG + 
TERRIBLE-[1h-version / used as an intensifier] + [context].If you mean that two things have such a strong resemblance that it seems 
unnatural you might want to add that GOOSEBUMPS sign. See: Goosebumps: https://youtu.be/g16JINNLKpgYou could match the concept to one of the dozens of other signs that you could 
use to mean "uncanny" (STRANGE, WEIRD, SEEM IMPOSSIBLE, SHOCKED, JAW DROP, 
WHIPLASH, etc.) -- depending on exactly what you mean.Consider the difference between:1. There is an uncanny resemblance.2. The resemblance is uncanny!There are many shades of meaning that could include: strong, can't explain it, 
spooky, shocking, etc. Each meaning might best be signed using a different 
combination of signs or different inflections of particular signs.See: Intense:  https://youtu.be/iIs-ZMgqy-8Notes:*
