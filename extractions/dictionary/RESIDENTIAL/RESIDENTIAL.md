The word "residential" means "having to do with living there."  So a 
good generally equivalent concept that can be used to mean "residential" 
would be "live there."See:LIVE / ADDRESSSee:THEREIf you mean "residence" then you should probably sign "home" or "house."See:HOMESee:HOUSEIf you mean residential school for the Deaf, then you should use sign for 
"Deaf School."To do the sign for "Deaf School" you do the sign for "school" but use "I" hands instead.(Memory aide:  In the "old days" people who did not "fit the norm" were 
placed in "institutions."  The word "institution" starts with the 
letter "I.")
The early Deaf schools were "institutions" for the Deaf.RESIDENTIAL-SCHOOL (Deaf School)See:Residential School for the Deaf
