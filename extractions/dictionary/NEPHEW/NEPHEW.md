The sign for nephew is done by holding a loose "N" up near the side 
			of your head and twisting it forward twice. Do it at or above the 
			level of your eyes. (Since if you do it lower it might be 
			interpreted as "niece.")NEPHEW:Animated: NEPHEWYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
