			LIVE HERE M-I-C-H YOU? (with raised eyebrows).  You could drop 
			the sign HERE and it would still work.  The raised eyebrows and 
			repeating YOU at the end is the equivalent of the auxiliary "do" 
			phrase, as in "Do you...?" -- and makes it clear that you are asking 
			for a response.-Dr. BillYou can learnAmerican Sign Language (ASL)online at American Sign Language University ™ASLresources by Lifeprint.com  ©  Dr. William Vicars
