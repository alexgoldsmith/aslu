American Sign Language: 
		"seahorse"SEAHORSE:Version 1:Spell S-E-A and sign horse.SEAHORSE:Version two: Sign sea and horse.SEAHORSE:Version 3: Classifier XYou would use this next version of the sign for "seahorse" after you've 
        already established that you are talking about seahorses.  This 
        version could be considered a "classifier" that shows the general size, 
        shape, and movement of a seahorse.  You could alter the movement 
        and shape of this to tell a story about how a seahorse was moving or 
        behaving.   You could add the left hand to your signing sphere 
        to indicate a second seahorse and show how they interact.*
