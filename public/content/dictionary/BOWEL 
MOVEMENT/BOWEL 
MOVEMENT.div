  Loosely grab the dominant "five hand" thumb with the base hand.
  <br/>
  Then move the dominant hand downward, representing...er...well you get the 
picture.
  <br/>
  The base hand stays (for the most part) stationary.Â  The movement is all in 
the dominant hand.

  Some people misuse this sign to mean 
the swear word "sh_t."
  <br/>
  But honestly folks this sign is the same sign I used with my kids when they were 
little to ask if they needed to "go poop."
  <br/>
  The above sign
  <i>
   isn't
  </i>
  a swear word. The swear word "sh_t" has a completely 
different movement, starting position, and ending position. Plus the swear word 
version of the sign uses an angry or disgusted facial expression.
