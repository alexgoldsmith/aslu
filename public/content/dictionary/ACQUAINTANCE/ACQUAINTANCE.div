   A asks:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Dr. Bill,
   <br/>
   Is there a sign for "acquaintance?" I am wondering because I have 
			one Deaf friend (I consider her a very good friend) and several Deaf 
			acquaintances.
   <br/>

   <br/>
   Dear Grace,
   <br/>
   There is no "one" specific, widely recognized sign for 
			"acquaintance."
   <br/>
   If you mean "acquaintance" as in "someone you know and associate" 
			but not necessarily a friend, you could sign "I KNOW HIM."
   <br/>
   In your situation you could sign I HAVE ONE good-FRIEND DEAF. I KNOW 
			SEVERAL OTHER DEAF.
   <br/>
   If you mean "acquaintance" as in "nice to make your acquaintance..." 
			then sign "NICE MEET-you."
   <br/>
   - Dr. Bill
