  The phrase "occupy wall street"Â could be signed several 
different ways. I'll show you how I sign it. If you you come across a way 
that makes more sense, or if you know of any Deaf people who are directly 
involved with the actual "occupy wall street" movement who sign it 
differently, do let me know.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  SEIZE = "occupy"

   There is a general sign for "wall," that generally refers to a 
"flat surface" that is "one side" of a room. But I recommend you spell
  </font>
  W-A-L-L as in the part of the title "Wall Street" since it isn't 
referring to a typical "wall."

    I was wondering if you know of any established sign/phrase for the occupy 
wall street movement, and if there are any established variations in 
relation to the different cities.
    <br/>
    Thank you,
    <br/>
    Beth

    Beth,
    <br/>
    I'm sure there are several variations out there but since you asked me, what 
I recommend is that:
    <br/>
    You would use SEIZE to = "occupy."
    <br/>
    Spell W-A-L-L since it is referring to something other than a "wall."
    <br/>
    Sign STREET using the "STREET/road/way/path" sign.
    <br/>
    For other locations sign SEIZE and then use the local sign for that 
location.
    <br/>
